## Overview

In the event that there's an issue when making a request to our API, we'll return a
standardized error response that describes the nature of the error in detail.

Read more below to get familiar with the error response format.

<Tip>
  Our error responses are based on the [RFC 7807 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807) - a
  widely used standard for HTTP APIs.
