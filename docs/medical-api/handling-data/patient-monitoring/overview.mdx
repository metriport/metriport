# Overview

**Patient Monitoring** is a comprehensive system that tracks patient movements and status changes through healthcare facilities in real-time. It provides immediate notifications when patients are admitted, transferred, or discharged, giving you the information you need to:

- **Coordinate Care**: Respond immediately to patient admissions and coordinate follow-up care
- **Track Patient Journey**: Monitor patient transfers between departments, units, or facilities
- **Ensure Continuity**: Stay informed about patient discharges to plan post-discharge care
- **Improve Outcomes**: Proactively manage high-risk patients and prevent readmissions

## Realtime Patient Notifications

The core of Patient Monitoring is [realtime patient notifications](/medical-api/handling-data/patient-monitoring/realtime-patient-notifications) - webhook-based alerts that provide immediate updates about your patients' healthcare events. These notifications include administrative and clinical data and enable you to build automated workflows around patient care.

Following the discharge, we will requery the networks for the most up-to-date clinical data from the participating healthcare institutions.

In the near future, we will also add patient monitoring support for updating laboratory and pharmaceutical data.

## Enabling Patient Monitoring with Cohorts

Patient Monitoring is enabled through [Cohorts](/medical-api/handling-data/patient-monitoring/cohort) - named collections of patients that share common characteristics or care requirements. Cohorts allow you to apply monitoring rules at scale and organize patients for targeted care management.
