## What does opt-in/out mean?

Opting refers to a patient’s choice about whether their medical data is included in Metriport’s network queries 
and shared with connected systems—opting in enables data retrieval and consolidation, 
while opting out stops any new data exchanges until the patient opts back in.


## Opt‑Out / Opt‑In a patient via Dashboard

1. **Go to Dashboard → Patients**  
    <img  
        className="h-100"  
        src="/images/home-to-patients.png"  
    />  
2. **Click on a patient** from the list:  
    <img  
        className="h-100"  
        src="/images/dashboard-patients-opt.png"  
    />  
3. **Open the actions menu** (⋯) on the far top right of the patient details page.  
    <img  
        className="h-100"  
        src="/images/patient-to-opt.png"  
    />
4. Choose **Opt Out of Networks** or **Opt In to Networks** depending on your intent:  
    <img  
        className="h-100"  
        src="/images/opt-out-button.png"  
    />

<Warning>
  If you opt a patient out, they will no longer participate in any ongoing network queries or data sharing until you opt them back in.
</Warning>

## Opt‑Out via API

Update a patient’s network opt‑out status programmatically. For full details, see the [HIE Opt‑Out API reference](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/hie-opt-out).
