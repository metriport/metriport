Metriport provides tools to transform your data for analytics and pipe it into warehouses like Snowflake, Redshift,
BigQuery, and more - enabling you to do population level analytics on your patient data.

There are two primary ways to perform analytics on your patient population data: Managed and Manual.

## Managed: Snowflake Data Warehouse

Metriport offers direct integration with Snowflake, allowing you to analyze your patient data in a
powerful, scalable cloud data warehouse. This approach provides:

- **Managed data transformation**: Metriport does the heavy lifting to get your data into an analytics
  ready data warehouse ðŸŽ‰
- **Near Real-time Analytics**: Query your patient data right after it's processed
- **Scalable Performance**: Leverage Snowflake's elastic compute resources for complex analytics
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Use Snowflake's `Secure Data Sharing` feature for secure data collaboration

### Setting Up Snowflake Integration

1. **Create a Snowflake Account**: Sign up for a 
<a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions" target="_blank">Business Critical Edition</a>
Snowflake account and share your account identification with us:
   - View account details:
      <img src="/images/data-transform-snowflake-accdetails.png" />
   - Copy these fields and share them with your Metriport account manager:
      - Organization Name
      - Account Name
      - Account Locator
      - Cloud Provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)
      - Region

2. **Access the data**: Metriport will share your patients' medical data with your Snowflake instance:
   - It uses Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro" target="_blank">Secure Data Sharing</a>
     for secure, compliant, and zero-copy data sharing between Metriport and your Snowflake account.
   - Data will be visible through Secure Views, one for each resource type.

## Manual: Tuva Data Model

To accomplish this, we standardize our data into the [Tuva data model](https://thetuvaproject.com/) - 
another open source project that focuses on making healthcare data more standardized for analytics.

The Tuva approach provides:

- **Open Source**: Transparent, community-driven data modeling
- **Healthcare-Specific Metrics**: Built-in calculations for common healthcare KPIs
- **Multi-Warehouse Support**: Works with Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and other warehouses

To get started with Tuva, check out our 
[data warehouse connector documentation](https://thetuvaproject.com/connectors/metriport) on the Tuva site.

## Schema Documentation

The Tuva data model consists of several core tables that represent different aspects of healthcare data. Each table is designed to capture specific information in a standardized format for analytics:

### Core Tables

- **[Condition](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/condition)** - Symptoms, problems, complaints, and diagnoses reported during encounters
- **[Encounter](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/encounter)** - Unique patient interactions with the healthcare system
- **[Immunization](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/immunization)** - Vaccines administered to patients
- **[Lab Result](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/lab-result)** - Laboratory test results with LOINC codes
- **[Location](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/location)** - Practice and facility locations where care is provided
- **[Medication](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/medication)** - Medications ordered or administered during encounters
- **[Observation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/observation)** - Clinical measurements like blood pressure, height, and weight
- **[Patient](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/patient)** - Patient demographic information and core patient data
- **[Practitioner](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/practitioner)** - Healthcare providers who deliver care
- **[Procedure](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/procedure)** - Procedures performed on patients

Each schema page provides detailed information about the table structure, including primary keys, foreign keys, and column definitions.
