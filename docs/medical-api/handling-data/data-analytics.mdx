Metriport provides tools to transform your data for analytics and pipe it into warehouses like Snowflake, Redshift,
BigQuery, and more - enabling you to do population level analytics on your patient data.

There are two primary ways to perform analytics on your patient population data:

## Option 1: Snowflake Data Warehouse

Metriport offers direct integration with Snowflake, allowing you to analyze your patient data in a
powerful, scalable cloud data warehouse. This approach provides:

- **Near Real-time Analytics**: Query your patient data right after it's processed
- **Scalable Performance**: Leverage Snowflake's elastic compute resources for complex analytics
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Use Snowflake's `Secure Data Sharing` feature for secure data collaboration

### Setting Up Snowflake Integration

1. **Create a Snowflake Account**: Sign up for a 
<a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions" target="_blank">Business Critical Edition</a>
Snowflake account and share you account identification with us:
   - View account details:
      <img src="/images/data-transform-snowflake-accdetails.png" />
   - Copy these fields and share them with your Metriport account manager:
      - Organization Name
      - Account Name
      - Account Locator

2. **Access the data**: Metriport will share your patients' medical data with your Snowflake instance:
   - It uses Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro" target="_blank">Secure Data Sharing</a>
     for secure, compliant, and zero-copy data sharing between Metriport and your Snowflake account.
   - Data will be visible through Secure Views, one for each resource type.

## Option 2: TUVA Data Model

To accomplish this, we standardize our data into the [Tuva data model](https://thetuvaproject.com/) - 
another open source project that focuses on making healthcare data more standardized for analytics.

The TUVA approach provides:

- **Standardized Healthcare Data Model**: Pre-built data models specifically designed for healthcare analytics
- **Open Source**: Transparent, community-driven data modeling
- **Healthcare-Specific Metrics**: Built-in calculations for common healthcare KPIs
- **Multi-Warehouse Support**: Works with Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and other warehouses

[data warehouse connector documentation](https://thetuvaproject.com/connectors/metriport) on the Tuva site.
