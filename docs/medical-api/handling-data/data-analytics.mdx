Metriport provides tools to transform your data for analytics and pipe it into warehouses like Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery,
and more - enabling you to do population level analytics on your patient data.

To accomplish this, we standardize our data into the [Tuva data model](https://thetuvaproject.com/) - another open source
project that focuses on making healthcare data more standardized for analytics.

To get started, check out our [data warehouse connector documentation](https://thetuvaproject.com/connectors/metriport) on the Tuva site.
