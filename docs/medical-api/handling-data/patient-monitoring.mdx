# Overview
Metriport supports two ways to access patient medical data:  
 - Adhoc: you ask for data whenever you need it (e.g., [Start Document Query](/medical-api/api-reference/document/start-document-query))  
 - Automated: you receive the data without initiating the request, either through [Realtime Patient Notifications](/medical-api/handling-data/realtime-patient-notifications) 
 or [Scheduled Queries](/medical-api/handling-data/scheduled-queries).

Patient Monitoring is the automated way to receive patient data.

# Real-time Patient Notifications
Metriportâ€™s Realtime Patient Notifications allows you to subscribe your patients to certain types of notifications.

These notifications include:  
 - ADTs (Admission, Discharge, Transfer)  
 - Pharmacy-related notifications  
 - Laboratory-related notifications  

For more information see [Real-time Patient Notifications](/medical-api/handling-data/realtime-patient-notifications).

# Scheduled Queries
This allows you to specify a schedule in which document queries should be executed automatically.

This is essentially an automated and scheduled version of [Start Document Query](/medical-api/api-reference/document/start-document-query).

You can choose one of the frequencies below for each of the Document Query source:
 - Weekly: runs every Saturday
 - Biweekly: runs every other Saturday, starting with the first Saturday of the month
 - Monthly: runs the last weekend of the month

For more details, see [Scheduled Queries](/medical-api/handling-data/scheduled-queries).
