# Overview
Metriport supports two ways to access patient medical data:  
 - **Adhoc**: you request data whenever you need it through various API endpoints (see [Start Document Query](/medical-api/api-reference/document/start-document-query) for an example)  
 - **Automated**: you receive the data without initiating the request, either through [Realtime Patient Notifications](/medical-api/handling-data/patient-monitoring#real-time-patient-notifications) 
 or [Scheduled Queries](/medical-api/handling-data/patient-monitoring#scheduled-queries).

Patient Monitoring is the automated way to receive patient data.

# Real-time Patient Notifications
Metriportâ€™s Realtime Patient Notifications allows you to subscribe your patients to certain types of notifications.

These notifications include:  
 - ADTs (Admission, Discharge, Transfer)  
 - Pharmacy-related notifications  
 - Laboratory-related notifications  

For more information see [Real-time Patient Notifications](/medical-api/handling-data/realtime-patient-notifications).

# Scheduled Queries
This allows you to specify a schedule in which queries should be executed automatically.

This is a scheduled version of adhoc data queries.

You can choose one of the [supported frequencies](/medical-api/handling-data/scheduled-queries#overview) to automatically trigger a Query for each of the supported sources.

For more details, see [Scheduled Queries](/medical-api/handling-data/scheduled-queries).
