# Overview

Metriport supports **Cohorts** - a way to create groups of patients for use within both your own system and Metriport. 

If you use Metriport to monitor patients for anything from ADT notifications to lab data, you'll do that via Cohorts. 
And if you've had the need to create groups of patients, or label and retrieve groups of patients by label, read on.

  If you're interested in learning more about cohorts for other use cases, 
  such as analytics or reporting, let us know at support@metriport.com

### The Cohort Model
In Metriport, a cohort is simply a label that can be given to any number of patients. You can use that label to apply common settings across that group of patients,
or retrieve the members of that cohort via API. 

```json
{
  name: "High Risk",
  description: "Members of this cohort are opted-in to all available data sources.",
  settings: {
    adtMonitoring: true,
    questMonitoring: true,
    // etc.
  }
}
```

When importing patients into metriport you can assign them to cohorts.
// Example api call

And easily retrieve them as a group.
// Example api call

### Getting started
Every cohort has a name and a collection of settings which apply to all patients within that cohort. 
By default, you have 3 cohorts with the following names + behaviors:

- Low Risk ( ðŸŸ¢ ): monthly medical record refresh
- Medium Risk ( ðŸŸ¡ ): monthly medical record refresh & prescription medication history
- High Risk ( ðŸ”´ ): <b>weekly medical record refresh</b>, and monitoring enabled for all available sources

<Note>
All of this can be personalized based on your needs, either during onboarding or self-serve, via our API (See our API reference for documentation on how to [update an existing cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/update-cohort) or [add existing patients to a cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)).
</Note>

### Adding patients to cohorts
Patients can be added to cohorts on creation, or added to and removed from different cohorts as needed.

During creation:
- In [Bulk Patient Create](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient) there are `cohort1` and `cohort2` column headers for specifying the starting cohorts for a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient#param-cohort1).
- In [Create Patient](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) there is a `cohorts` array parameter to set any number of cohorts on a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient#param-cohort1).

As needed:
- Refer to [Add Patients To Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/add-patients-to-cohort)
- Refer to [Remove Patients From Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/remove-patients-from-cohort)
