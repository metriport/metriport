# Overview

Metriport supports **Cohorts** - a way to create groups of patients for use within both your own system and Metriport. 

If you use Metriport to monitor patients for anything from ADT notifications to lab data, you'll do that via Cohorts. 
And if you've had the need to create groups of patients, or label and retrieve groups of patients by label, read on.

  If you're interested in learning more about cohorts for other use cases, 
  such as analytics or reporting, let us know at support@metriport.com

### The Cohort Model
In Metriport, a cohort is simply a label that can be given to any number of patients. You can use that label to apply common settings across that group of patients,
or retrieve the members of that cohort via API. 

```json
{
  name: "High Risk",
  description: "Members of this cohort are opted-in to all available data sources.",
  settings: {
    adtMonitoring: true,
    questMonitoring: true,
    // etc.
  }
}
```

When importing patients into metriport you can assign them to cohorts.
// Example api call

And easily retrieve them as a group.
// Example api call

### Cohorts for patient monitoring
Every cohort has a name and a collection of settings which apply to all patients that are members of that cohort. 
By default, you have 3 cohorts pre-created, with the following behaviors:

- Low Risk ( ðŸŸ¢ ): monthly medical record refresh
- Medium Risk ( ðŸŸ¡ ): monthly medical record refresh & prescription medication history
- High Risk ( ðŸ”´ ): <b>weekly medical record refresh</b>, and monitoring enabled for all available sources

<Note>
All of this can be personalized based on your needs, either during onboarding or self-served via our API (See our API reference for documentation on how to [update an existing cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/update-cohort) or [add existing patients to a cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)).
</Note>

### Cohorts for convenience

For each patient you intend to receive realtime notifications for, Metriport maintains the real-time state of their journey through the health system.
Each of these patient journeys is represented via FHIR data - a FHIR [Encounter](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html).

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Encounter",
  "status": "finished",
  "period": {
    "start": "2024-03-15T14:20:00.000Z",
    "end": "2024-03-15T16:45:00.000Z"
  },
  "reasonCode": [
    {
      "text": "Chest pain"
    }
  ],
  "location": [
    {
      "location": {
        "reference": "Location/3ca5e8d2-7c84-45ab-91e7-834f8becde12",
        "type": "Location",
        "display": "Memorial Hospital"
      }
    }
  ]
  // And much more
}
```

But FHIR data relies on references to function. An Encounter might reference a subject, a practitioner, or a location - as the example above does (see the `reference` field in location.). Each root unit of data in FHIR is called a 'Resource' and each of type of resource has its own corresponding schema. It's common for resources to include references to one another.

To provide comprehensive data about the Encounter, we serve a FHIR [Bundle](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) via the `url` in the patient notification.

```json
{
    "resourceType": "Bundle",
    "type": "message",
    "timestamp": "2020-05-08T13:10:15Z",
    "id": "message-uuid",
    "entry": [
      { /* a FHIR Encounter */ },
      // Other resources that are directly or transitively referenced via the FHIR encounter
      { /* Another resource */ },
      { /* Another resource */ },
      { /* Another resource */ },
      ...
    ]
}
```

The first item in every bundle for a Metriport's Patient Notification is the root Encounter. Every item thereafter is a resource referenced by the Encounter. The bundle acts as a container for all resources, ensuring you have a standalone package of clinical data.
