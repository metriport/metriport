# Overview
Metriport supports **Cohorts** - a way to create groups of patients for use within both your own system and Metriport. 
If you use Metriport to monitor patients for anything from ADT notifications to lab data, you'll do that by adding your patients to Cohorts.

<Info>
  If you're interested in learning more about cohorts for
  other use cases, such as analytics or reporting, let us
  know at support@metriport.com

### The Cohort Model

In Metriport, a cohort is simply a label that can be given to any number of patients. You can use that label to apply common settings across that group of patients,
or retrieve the members of that cohort via API.

```json
{
  "name": "High Risk",
  "description": "Members of this cohort are opted-in to all available data sources.",
  "settings": {
    "adtMonitoring": true,
    "questMonitoring": true
    // etc.
  }
}
```

### Getting started

Every cohort has a name and a collection of settings which apply to all patients within that cohort.
By default, you have 3 cohorts with the following names + behaviors:

- Low Risk ( ðŸŸ¢ ): monthly medical record refresh
- Medium Risk ( ðŸŸ¡ ): monthly medical record refresh & prescription medication history
- High Risk ( ðŸ”´ ): <b>weekly medical record refresh</b>, and monitoring enabled for all available sources

<Note>
  All of this can be personalized based on your needs,
  either during onboarding or self-serve, via our API (See
  our API reference for documentation on how to [update an
  existing
  cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/update-cohort)
  or [add existing patients to a
  cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)).
</Note>

### Adding patients to cohorts

Patients can be added to cohorts on creation, or added to and removed from different cohorts as needed.

During creation:

- In [Bulk Patient Create](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient) there are `cohort1` and `cohort2` column headers for specifying the starting cohorts for a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient#param-cohort1).
- In [Create Patient](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) there is a `cohorts` array parameter to set any number of cohorts on a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient#param-cohort1).

As needed:

- Refer to endpoint [POST - Add Patients To Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/add-patients-to-cohort)
- Refer to endpoint [DELETE - Remove Patients From Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/remove-patients-from-cohort)

### Monitoring patients with Cohorts

Metriport allows you to monitor patients and receive notifications about them throughout their care.

To do this, you create a cohort and specify the settings directly on the cohort. Then add patients that need to be monitored on the cohort, and those monitoring settings will be applied to the patient..

```typescript
// 1. Create a cohort
const { cohort } = await metriportApi.createCohort({
  name: "My Custom Cohort"
  description: "This is my first cohort",
  color: "purple",
  settings: {
    adtMonitoring: true
  }
 });

// 2. Add patients to the cohort
const patientsInCohort = await metriportApi.addPatientsToCohort({
  cohortId: cohort.id,
  patientIds: [
    "patient-uuid-1",
    "patient-uuid-2",
    "patient-uuid-3",
  ]
});

// ðŸŽ‰ Your patients are now subscribed to ADT notifications!
```

<Tip>
  Setting a patient's cohorts as you create them is the
  easiest way + recommended way of enabling monitoring.
</Tip>

Alternatively, just create your patients as usual (via API call or bulk patient create) but pass in cohorts.

```typescript
// Create a patient and assign to existing cohorts
const patient = await metriportApi.createPatient(
  {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    dob: "1990-01-01",
    genderAtBirth: "M",
    address: [
      {
        addressLine1: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown",
        state: "CA",
        zip: "12345",
        country: "USA",
      },
    ],
    cohorts: ["High Risk", "My Custom Cohort"], // Assign cohorts during creation
  },
  facilityId
);

// The patient is now automatically subscribed to all monitoring settings
// from both the "High Risk" and "My Custom Cohort" cohorts
```

### Cohorts for convenience

Additionally, you can use Cohorts to label your patients for your own purposes. 
A cohort does not need to have any monitoring settings enabled - you can simply group patients 
and paginate over them and patients can be a member of any number of cohorts - try it out and share your
