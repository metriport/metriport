# Overview

Metriport's **Realtime Patient Notifications** are your way to receive realtime updates on a patient's journey through a health system. You can trigger a workflow once a patient is admitted to a health system, check their diagnosis within moments of them being discharged, and so much more.

## Working with Realtime Patient Notifications

### Webhook schema [(Event Reference)](#event-reference)

Each realtime notification we send via webhook has a payload that includes key information about the event, and a url field to JSON containing robust clinical data for the encounter.

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "messageId": "1e82424a-1220-473d-a0d1-6e5fde15159e",
    "when": "2025-01-30T23:00:01.000Z",
    "type": "patient.admit"
  },
  "payload": {
    "url": "<presigned-download-url>",
    "patientId": "metriport-patient-uuid",
    "externalId": "your-first-party-id",
    "additionalIds": {
      "athenahealth": ["99992"]
    },
    "admitTimestamp": "2025-01-28T23:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

If you want to access the clinical data, you need only download the json from the url. To work with the data, we recommend you understand [The Encounter Model](#the-encounter-model) below.

<Info>
  The URL remains valid and available for download for 600
  seconds (10 minutes).
</Info>

### The Encounter Model

For each patient you intend to receive realtime notifications for, Metriport maintains the real-time state of their journey through the health system.
Each of these patient journeys is represented via FHIR data - a FHIR [Encounter](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html).

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Encounter",
  "status": "finished",
  "period": {
    "start": "2024-03-15T14:20:00.000Z",
    "end": "2024-03-15T16:45:00.000Z"
  },
  "reasonCode": [
    {
      "text": "Chest pain"
    }
  ],
  "location": [
    {
      "location": {
        "reference": "Location/3ca5e8d2-7c84-45ab-91e7-834f8becde12",
        "type": "Location",
        "display": "Memorial Hospital"
      }
    }
  ]
  // And much more
}
```

But FHIR data relies on references to function. An Encounter might reference a subject, a practitioner, or a location - as the example above does (see the `reference` field in location.). Each root unit of data in FHIR is called a 'Resource' and each of type of resource has its own corresponding schema. It's common for resources to include references to one another.

To provide comprehensive data about the Encounter, we serve a FHIR [Bundle](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) via the `url` in the patient notification.

```json
{
    "resourceType": "Bundle",
    "type": "message",
    "timestamp": "2020-05-08T13:10:15Z",
    "id": "message-uuid",
    "entry": [
      { /* a FHIR Encounter */ },
      // Other resources that are directly or transitively referenced via the FHIR encounter
      { /* Another resource */ },
      { /* Another resource */ },
      { /* Another resource */ },
      ...
    ]
}
```

The first item in every bundle for a Metriport's Patient Notification is the root Encounter. Every item thereafter is a resource referenced by the Encounter. The bundle acts as a container for all resources, ensuring you have a standalone package of clinical data.

If you're unfamiliar with FHIR, please read our [FHIR Overview](medical-api/fhir/overview).

### Handling Patient Notifications

We may extend the patient notification types, so we recommend that you do a **strict** match when checking the handler type. If using a typed language like typescript, this also allows you to typecast the payload based on the appropriate event type.

See below.

```typescript
import {
  PatientAdmitPayload,
  PatientDischargePayload,
} from "@metriport/api-sdk";

if (event.meta.type === "patient.admit") {
  const payload = event.payload as PatientAdmitPayload;
  // process admit message
}
if (event.meta.type === "patient.transfer") {
  const payload = event.payload as PatientTransferPayload;
  // process transfer message
}
if (event.meta.type === "patient.discharge") {
  const payload = event.payload as PatientDischargePayload;
  // process discharge message
}
```

## Event Reference

### `patient.admit`

A Patient Admit event is emitted when a patient undergoes the admission process, assigning them a bed. It signals the official start of a patient's stay in a healthcare facility. It includes short stay and "John Doe" (patient name unknown) admissions.
