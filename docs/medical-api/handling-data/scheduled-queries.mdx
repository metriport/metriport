# Overview
Scheduled Queries is an automated and scheduled version of [Start Document Query](/medical-api/api-reference/document/start-document-query).

It allows you to specify a schedule in which document queries should be executed automatically.

You can choose one of the frequencies below for each of the document query source:
 - `weekly`: runs every Saturday.  
 - `biweekly`: runs every other Saturday, starting with the first Saturday of the month.  
 - `monthly`: runs the last weekend of the month.  

The available data sources are:
 - `hie`: health information networks, nation-wide networks that provide access to general medical data.  
 - `pharmacy`: networks that provide medication-specific information.  
 - `laboratory`: networks that provide information specific to tests/results and other laboratory-related data.  

<Info>
    **HIE monitoring** and **Pharmacy scheduled monitoring are coming soon!** While these features are not yet live, [you can configure 
    your monitoring settings now](/medical-api/handling-data/cohorts). These settings will automatically take effect when the feature launches.
</Info>


To use this feature, [set it up in one or more Cohorts](/medical-api/handling-data/cohorts) and associate the patients you want to have enabled for each schedule.
