# Overview

Cohorts allow you to configure shared patient settings. 
For example, you could create one cohort to monitor a group of 
chronically-ill individuals with all features enabled (e.g., ADTs, pharmacies, laboratory, HIE), and another cohort 
that monitors a less critical group of individuals with just HIE data enabled.

<Warning>
  Attempting to enable **ADT**, **pharmacy**, or **laboratory** monitoring settings 
  for an account without the monitoring service activated will result in a 400 error.  
  These are premium features - if you'd like access to them, contact us and let us know!
</Warning>

# Getting started

Every cohort has a unique name and a collection of settings which apply to all patients within that cohort. 
These settings control what data sources are monitored, how frequently queries are run, and what notifications are sent.

A patient can be in multiple cohorts, which allows for flexible monitoring configurations. 
When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts, the most permissive settings are applied. 
If any cohort enables a particular monitoring feature, that feature will be active for the patient. 

<Note>
  All of this can be personalized based on your needs,
  either during onboarding or self-serve, via our API (See
  our API reference for documentation on how to [update an
  existing
  cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/update-cohort)
  or [add existing patients to a
  cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)).
</Note>

# The Cohort Model

In Metriport, a cohort is simply a label that can be given to any number of patients. You can 
use that label to apply common settings across a group of patients,
or retrieve the members of that cohort via API.

```json
{
  "name": "High Risk",
  "description": "Members of this cohort are opted-in to all available data sources.",
  "color": "red",
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      "hie": {
        "enabled": true,
        "frequency": "weekly"
      },
      "pharmacy": {
        "notifications": true,
        "schedule": {
          "enabled": false,
          "frequency": "monthly"
        }
      },
      "laboratory": {
        "notifications": true,
        "schedule": {
          "enabled": false,
          "frequency": "monthly"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
See [Here](/medical-api/handling-data/cohorts#available-settings) for a detailed explanation of the available settings.

# Monitoring patients with Cohorts

Metriport allows you to monitor patients and receive notifications about them over time.

To do this, create a cohort and specify the settings directly on the cohort. Then add patients that need to be monitored to the cohort. 
The settings of the cohort are now applied to the patient (what monitoring is set, schedule, etc.).

```typescript
// 1. Create a cohort
const cohort = await metriportApi.createCohort({
  name: "My Custom Cohort",
  description: "This is my first cohort",
  color: "purple",
  settings: {
    monitoring: {
      adt: {
        enabled: true
      }
    }
  }
 });

// 2. Add patients to the cohort
const patientsInCohort = await metriportApi.addPatientsToCohort({
  cohortId: cohort.id,
  patientIds: [
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
  ]
});

// ðŸŽ‰ Your patients are now subscribed to ADT notifications!
```

<Tip>
  Setting a patient's cohorts as you create them is the
  easiest way + recommended way of enabling monitoring.
</Tip>

Alternatively, just create your patients as usual (via API call or bulk patient create) and specify the desired cohorts.

```typescript
// Create a patient and assign to existing cohorts
const patient = await metriportApi.createPatient(
  {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    dob: "1990-01-01",
    genderAtBirth: "M",
    address: [
      {
        addressLine1: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown",
        state: "CA",
        zip: "12345",
        country: "USA",
      },
    ],
    // Assign cohorts during creation
    cohorts: [
      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", 
      "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
    ], 
  },
  facilityId
);

// The patient is now automatically subscribed to the monitoring settings of the 2 cohorts
```

## Adding patients to cohorts

Patients can be added to cohorts on creation, or added to and removed from different cohorts as needed.

During creation:

- In [Bulk Patient Create](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient) 
there are `cohort1` and `cohort2` column headers for specifying the starting cohorts for a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient#param-cohort1).
- In [Create Patient](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) 
there is a `cohorts` array parameter to set any number of cohorts on a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient#param-cohorts).

As needed:

- [Add Patients To Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)
- [Remove Patients From Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/remove-patients-from-cohort)
