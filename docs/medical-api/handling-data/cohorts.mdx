# Overview

Cohorts allow you to configure shared patient settings. 
For example, you could create one cohort to monitor a group of 
chronically-ill individuals with all features enabled (e.g., ADTs, pharmacies, laboratory, HIE), and another cohort 
that monitors a less critical group of individuals with just HIE data enabled.

### Getting started

Every cohort has a unique name and a collection of settings which apply to all patients within that cohort.
By default, you have 3 cohorts with the following names + behaviors:

- Low Risk ( ðŸŸ¢ ): Monthly medical record refresh & no additional monitoring 
- Medium Risk( ðŸŸ¡ ): Monthly medical record refresh & prescription medication history  
- High Risk ( ðŸ”´ ): Weekly medical record refresh & monitoring enabled for all available sources

<Note>
  All of this can be personalized based on your needs,
  either during onboarding or self-serve, via our API (See
  our API reference for documentation on how to [update an
  existing
  cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/update-cohort)
  or [add existing patients to a
  cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)).
</Note>

### The Cohort Model

In Metriport, a cohort is simply a label that can be given to any number of patients. You can use that label to apply common settings across a group of patients,
or retrieve the members of that cohort via API.

```json
{
  "name": "High Risk",
  "description": "Members of this cohort are opted-in to all available data sources.",
  "color": "red",
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": true,
      "hie": "weekly",
      "pharmacy": {
        "notifications": true,
        "schedule": "never"
      },
      "laboratory": {
        "notifications": true,
        "schedule": "never"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
See [Here](/medical-api/handling-data/cohorts#available-settings) for a detailed explanation of the available settings.

### Monitoring patients with Cohorts

Metriport allows you to monitor patients and receive notifications about them over time.

To do this, create a cohort and specify the settings directly on the cohort. Then add patients that need to be monitored to the cohort. 
The settings of the cohort are now applied to the patient (what monitoring is set, schedule, etc.).

```typescript
// 1. Create a cohort
const { cohort } = await metriportApi.createCohort({
  name: "My Custom Cohort",
  description: "This is my first cohort",
  color: "purple",
  settings: {
    monitoring: {
      adt: true
    }
  }
 });

// 2. Add patients to the cohort
const patientsInCohort = await metriportApi.addPatientsToCohort({
  cohortId: cohort.id,
  patientIds: [
    "patient-uuid-1",
    "patient-uuid-2",
    "patient-uuid-3",
  ]
});

// ðŸŽ‰ Your patients are now subscribed to ADT notifications!
```

<Tip>
  Setting a patient's cohorts as you create them is the
  easiest way + recommended way of enabling monitoring.
</Tip>

Alternatively, just create your patients as usual (via API call or bulk patient create) and specify the desired cohorts.

```typescript
// Create a patient and assign to existing cohorts
const patient = await metriportApi.createPatient(
  {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    dob: "1990-01-01",
    genderAtBirth: "M",
    address: [
      {
        addressLine1: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown",
        state: "CA",
        zip: "12345",
        country: "USA",
      },
    ],
    // Assign cohorts during creation
    cohorts: [
      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", 
      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    ], 
  },
  facilityId
);

// The patient is now automatically subscribed to the monitoring settings of the 2 cohorts
```

### Adding patients to cohorts

Patients can be added to cohorts on creation, or added to and removed from different cohorts as needed.

During creation:

- In [Bulk Patient Create](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient) there are `cohort1` and `cohort2` column headers for specifying the starting cohorts for a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/bulk-create-patient#param-cohort1).
- In [Create Patient](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) there is a `cohorts` array parameter to set any number of cohorts on a patient. See [here](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient#param-cohorts).

As needed:

- [Add Patients To Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/add-patients-to-cohort)
- [Remove Patients From Cohort](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/remove-patients-from-cohort)



### Available settings

Use settings to enable monitoring for certain data sources.

<Warning>
  Attempting to enable **ADT**, **pharmacy**, or **laboratory** monitoring settings for an account without the monitoring service activated will result in a 400 error.  
  These are premium features - if youâ€™d like access to them, contact us and let us know!
</Warning>

<ResponseField name="hie" type="string" optional>
  HIE-based document monitoring - subscribes patients to HIE-based document monitoring (non-ADT) / medical record refresh based on the cadence. Can be one of `never`, `monthly`, `biweekly`, `weekly`.
  <Info>
    **HIE monitoring is coming soon!** While this feature is not yet live, you can configure your HIE monitoring settings now. These settings will automatically take effect when the feature launches.
  </Info>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="adt" type="boolean" optional>
  ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) monitoring - subscribes patients to ADT notifications based on their [primary address state](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient#param-is-primary).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pharmacy" type="object" optional>
  Pharmacy / medication history monitoring - enables retail fill data monitoring where available.  
  <Expandable title="pharmacy object properties">
    <ResponseField name="notifications" type="boolean" optional>
      Enable/disable pharmacy monitoring notifications
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="schedule" type="string" optional>
      Enable pharmacy data pulls at scheduled dates. Can be one of `never`, `monthly`, `biweekly`, `weekly`.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="laboratory" type="object" optional>
  Laboratory notifications - subscribes patients for ongoing notifications of new lab results.  
  <Expandable title="laboratory object properties">
    <ResponseField name="notifications" type="boolean" optional>
      Enable/disable laboratory monitoring notifications
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="schedule" type="string" optional>
      Enable laboratory data pulls at scheduled dates. Can be one of `never`, `monthly`, `biweekly`, `weekly`.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  For **pharmacy** and **laboratory** monitoring, choose either `notifications` OR `schedule`, but not both. If `notifications` is `true`, `schedule` value is ignored.
</Info>

#### How are settings combined across multiple cohorts?

When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts, their settings are aggregated from all cohorts they belong to. 
If there are conflicting settings between cohorts, the least restrictive option is applied (logical OR). 
See [get patient settings](/medical-api/api-reference/cohort/get-patient-settings) for details.
