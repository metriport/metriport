A diagnostic report is the set of information that is typically provided by a diagnostic service when investigations are complete. The information includes a mix of atomic results, text reports, images, and codes. 

**Reference Table:**

The `diagnostic_report_references` table contains normalized references from the diagnostic report to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject** (required): links to the patient who is the subject of the diagnostic report
* **encounter**: links to the encounter where the diagnostic report was generated
* **performer**: links to practitioners who performed the diagnostic procedure
* **result**: links to observations or other diagnostic results referenced in the report

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).

**Presented Forms:**
For information about the `diagnostic_report_presented_forms` table that contains the actual content of diagnostic reports (text, images, and other media), see the [Diagnostic Report Presented Forms](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/diagnostic-report-presented-forms) documentation.
