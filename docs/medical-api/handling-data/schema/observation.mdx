The observation resource is used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns and even capture demographic characteristics.

**Normalization Note:**
Normalization of coding systems only occurs when the source coding system is one of: LOINC or SNOMED CT. Other coding systems will not have normalized codes.

**Reference Table:**
The `observation_references` table contains normalized references from the observation to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: links to the patient who is the subject of the observation
* **encounter**: links to the encounter where the observation was made
* **performer**: links to practitioners who performed the observation

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).

**Observation:**
The `observation` table stores clinical measurements, laboratory results, vital signs, and other clinical findings for patients.

**Primary Keys:**
* observation_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
