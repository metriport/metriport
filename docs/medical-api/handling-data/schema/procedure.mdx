The procedure table contains information on procedures performed on patients, including procedure codes, descriptions, and performance dates.

**Normalization Note:**
Normalization of coding systems only occurs when the source coding system is one of: CPT, HCPCS, LOINC, or SNOMED CT. Other coding systems will not have normalized codes.

**Primary Keys:**
* procedure_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
* practitioner_id
