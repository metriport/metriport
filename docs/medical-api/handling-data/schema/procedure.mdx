The procedure table contains information on procedures performed on patients, including procedure codes, descriptions, and performance dates.

**Normalization Note:**
This table does not include normalized coding fields as procedure data uses different coding systems that are not normalized in the current implementation.

**Primary Keys:**
* procedure_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* person_id
* patient_id
* encounter_id
* practitioner_id
* location_id
