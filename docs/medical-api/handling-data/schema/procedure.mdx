The procedure resource is used to record the details of current and historical procedures performed on or for a patient. A procedure is an activity that is performed on, with, or for a patient as part of the provision of care.

**Normalization Note:**
Normalization of coding systems only occurs when the source coding system is one of: CPT, LOINC, SNOMED CT, or HCPCS. Other coding systems will not have normalized codes.

**Reference Table:**
The `procedure_references` table contains normalized references from the procedure to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: links to the patient who underwent the procedure
* **encounter**: links to the encounter where the procedure was performed
* **performer**: links to practitioners who performed the procedure
* **location**: links to the location where the procedure was performed
* **report**: links to diagnostic reports or other documents related to the procedure

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).

**Procedure:**
The `procedure` table records medical procedures performed on patients, including surgical procedures, diagnostic tests, and other clinical interventions.

**Primary Keys:**
* procedure_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
