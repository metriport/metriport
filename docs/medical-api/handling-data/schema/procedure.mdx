The procedure table contains information on procedures performed on patients, including procedure codes, descriptions, and performance dates.

**Normalization Note:**
Normalization of coding systems only occurs when the source coding system is one of: CPT, LOINC, SNOMED CT, or HCPCS. Other coding systems will not have normalized codes.

**Reference Table:**
The `procedure_references` table contains normalized references from the procedure to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: Links to the patient who underwent the procedure
* **encounter**: Links to the encounter where the procedure was performed
* **performer**: Links to practitioners who performed the procedure
* **location**: Links to the location where the procedure was performed
* **report**: Links to diagnostic reports or other documents related to the procedure

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).

**Primary Keys:**
* procedure_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
