A condition is any sort of symptom, problem, complaint, admitting diagnosis, or billing diagnosis as reported by the patient, a clinician, or as otherwise generated (e.g. by the billing process). Key ancillary data related to condition includes the date it was reported, its clinical status, and any relevant body site information.

**Normalization Note:**
Normalization of coding systems only occurs when the source coding system is one of: ICD-10-CM, SNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, or LOINC. Other coding systems will not have normalized codes.

**Reference Table:**
The `condition_references` table contains normalized references from the condition to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: Links to the patient who has the condition
* **encounter**: Links to the encounter where the condition was recorded
* **recorder**: Links to the practitioner who recorded the condition

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).

**Primary Keys:**
* condition_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
