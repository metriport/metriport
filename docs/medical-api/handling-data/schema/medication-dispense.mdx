A medication dispense record represents the dispensing of a medication to a patient. This includes details about when the medication was prepared, dispensed, and the quantity provided.

**Reference Table:**

The `medication_dispense_references` table contains normalized references from the medication dispense to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **medication_reference**: links to the medication that was dispensed
* **subject**: links to the patient who received the medication
* **performer**: links to practitioners who performed the dispensing
* **location**: links to the location where the medication was dispensed

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).
