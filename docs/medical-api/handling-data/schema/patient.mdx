The patient table contains information on patients, including demographic information such as birth date, gender, race, and ethnicity. This is the core table that contains this information.

**Normalization Note:**
This table does not include normalized coding fields as patient demographic data uses different coding systems that are not normalized in the current implementation.

**Primary Keys:**
* person_id
