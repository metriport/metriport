A medication request record represents a request for a medication to be prescribed or administered to a patient. This includes details about the medication requested, dosing, and the practitioner making the request.

**Reference Table:**

The `medication_request_references` table contains normalized references from the medication request to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **medication_reference**: links to the medication that was requested
* **subject**: links to the patient for whom the medication was requested
* **encounter**: links to the encounter where the request was made
* **requester**: links to the practitioner who made the request
* **reason_reference**: links to conditions or other reasons for the medication request

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).
