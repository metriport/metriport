A medication administration record represents the actual administration of a medication to a patient. This includes details about when, how, and by whom the medication was administered.

**Reference Table:**
The `medication_administration_references` table contains normalized references from the medication administration to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **medication_reference**: links to the medication that was administered
* **subject**: links to the patient who received the medication
* **performer**: links to practitioners who performed the administration

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).
