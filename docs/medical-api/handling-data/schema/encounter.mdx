An encounter encompasses the lifecycle from pre-admission, the actual encounter (for ambulatory encounters), and admission, stay and discharge (for inpatient encounters). During the encounter the patient may move from practitioner to practitioner and location to location.

**Reference Table:**

The `encounter_references` table contains normalized references from the encounter to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: links to the patient involved in the encounter
* **participant.individual**: links to practitioners and other participants in the encounter
* **location.location**: links to locations where the encounter occurred
* **diagnosis.condition**: links to condition outcomes from the encounter

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).

**Encounter Table:**

**Primary Keys:**
* encounter_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
