Reference tables are normalized tables that store FHIR resource references in a structured format. They provide a consistent way to link resources across the Metriport data model.

**Reference Tables:**

Each reference table contains the following columns:

| Column | Data Type | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| `{resource_id_field}` | varchar | The ID of the parent resource (e.g., `diagnostic_report_id`, `encounter_id`) |
| `property` | varchar | The FHIR property name that contains the reference (e.g., 'performer', 'result', 'subject') |
| `reference_id` | varchar | The extracted reference ID from the FHIR reference string |
| `reference_type` | varchar | The resource type being referenced (e.g., 'Patient', 'Practitioner', 'Observation') |
