The immunization resource is intended to cover the recording of current and historical administration of vaccines to patients across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions. This includes immunization of both humans and animals but does not include the administration of non-vaccine agents, even those that may have or claim to have immunological effects.

**Reference Table:**

The `immunization_references` table contains normalized references from the immunization to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: links to the patient who received the immunization
* **encounter**: links to the encounter where the immunization was administered
* **location**: links to the location where the medication was dispensed
* **performer.actor**: links to practitioners who performed the immunization

For detailed information about reference table structure and indexing, see the [Reference Tables documentation](/medical-api/handling-data/schema/reference-tables).
