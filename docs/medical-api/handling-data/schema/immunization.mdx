The immunization table contains information on immunizations administered to patients, including the vaccine code, description, and administration date.

Vaccine codes are normalized to CVX (Vaccine Administered) coding system. The cvx_code and cvx_display fields contain the standardized CVX values.

**Reference Table:**
The `immunization_references` table contains normalized references from the immunization to other entities. It supports the following reference properties:
* **subject**: Links to the patient who received the immunization
* **encounter**: Links to the encounter where the immunization was administered
* **performer**: Links to practitioners who performed the immunization

**Primary Key:**
* immunization_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
