The immunization table contains information on immunizations administered to patients, including the vaccine code, description, and administration date.

**Normalization Note:**
Normalization of coding systems only occurs when the source coding system is CVX. Other coding systems will not have normalized codes.

**Primary Key:**
* immunization_id

**Foreign Keys:**
* patient_id
* practitioner_id
