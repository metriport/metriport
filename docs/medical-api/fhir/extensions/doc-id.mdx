In some cases, when querying for FHIR Resources, you may want to download the Document
corresponding to a Resource - you can use the information found in this extension to
do so.

For example, this is helpful to answer questions such as "what Progress Note does this Encounter
correspond to?".

```

<Tip>

  which the FHIR Resource was derived from.
