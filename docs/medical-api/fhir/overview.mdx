In order to standardize medical data coming from a variety of sources, Metriport makes use
of the [HL7 FHIR R4 data standard](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).

## What is FHIR?

FHIR (pronounced `fire`ðŸ”¥) is a data standard that represents various healhcare concepts,
and is used to facilitate interoperability between healthcare IT systems.

You can think of it like this: every API has a spec, along with some data models, so that different systems
can communicate with the API - FHIR is the modern spec that allows healthcare IT systems to
communicate with each other.

## Resources & Data Types

After you initiate a new document query for a given patient, Metriport will automatically convert
any newly found C-CDA documents from XML to the corresponding FHIR Resources in JSON.

A FHIR Resource is a representation of some concept related to healthcare. Some examples include:

- [Encounter](/medical-api/fhir/resources/encounter): an interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s).
- [MedicationRequest](/medical-api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest): an order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the medication to a patient.
- [Observation](/medical-api/fhir/resources/observation): measurements about a patient - ie weight, height, blood pressure, etc.

In JSON, an Observation Resource would look like this, for example:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "id": "D19DA918-0F16-11EE-B2A6-A2F55214B7C1",

You're able to query for a Patient's FHIR Resources using the [Get Patient's Consolidated Data
Endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/get-patient-consolidated).

Additionally, to meet data contribution requirements, you're able to provide new data about a
Patient using the [Add Patient Data endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/add-patient-data).

<Tip>
  You can see the [HL7 FHIR Resource Index](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html) for an
  overview of various FHIR Resources by category, as well as our [Resource
  List](/medical-api/fhir/resources).
</Tip>

FHIR Resources each have their own specification for properties that may be included in the Resource,
and they may contain one or more of the [defined Data Types](/medical-api/fhir/data-types).

## Extensions

The FHIR specification is fairly flexible, and it allows for additions on every base resource through
"Extensions". This allows healthcare IT systems to provide more information to the resource, that
may be relevant to their specific implementation.

Extensions can be available under the `extension` property on any FHIR Resource, and also
have their own [specification for data they can contain](/medical-api/fhir/data-types/extension).

For example, Metriport introduces a [Document ID extension](/medical-api/fhir/extensions/doc-id) that allows you to get the C-CDA Document ID
for which any given FHIR Resource is derived from.
