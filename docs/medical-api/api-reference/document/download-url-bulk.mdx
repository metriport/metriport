title: "Start Bulk Get Document URL"
description: "Triggers a process to generate a list of download URLs for all of the patient's documents."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/download-url/bulk"
---
When executed, this endpoint triggers a process to generate all download URLs for a patient's documents, which will then be delivered via webhook message.

The status of the process is returned in the response. Initially, it will be `processing`, and when the process is finished, the status will be updated to `completed` or `failed`.

<Tip>
  The result of the process will be delivered via a webhook message - to set this up, and see the message format, check out our [webhooks guide](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks#bulk-downloadable-url-generation). 
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you trigger this endpoint again while the process is still running, you will get a response that reflects the current progress. Essentially, only a single bulk URL generation process will be running for a patient at any given time.
</Warning>
