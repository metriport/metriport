title: "Start Bulk Get Document URL"
description: "Triggers a process to generate a list of download URLs for all of the patient's documents."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/download-url/bulk"
---
When executed, this endpoint triggers a process to generate all download URLs for a patient's documents.
This is an asynchronous process, and the status is returned in the response to the original request.

Initially, the status will be `processing`, and when the process is finished, the status will be updated to
`completed` or `failed`.

Once completed, a webhook request will be sent [your configured URL](/home/api-reference/settings/post-settings)
containing the document download URLs. The url will be valid for 10 minutes after which it will expire.

Webhook message type - see [the respective section on the webhooks page](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks#bulk-downloadable-url-generation)
for more details:

- `medical.document-bulk-download`: list of download urls for a patient's documents.

<Warning>
  If you trigger this endpoint again while the process is still running, you will get a response that reflects the current progress. Essentially, only a single bulk URL generation process will be running for a patient at any given time.
