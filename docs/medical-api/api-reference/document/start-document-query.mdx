title: "Start Document Query"
description: "Triggers a document query for the specified patient across HIEs."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/query"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous document query across HIEs. This is a two step process where the documents will
first be downloaded from the respective HIE and, if they are C-CDA/XML, then converted to FHIR.

Each process (download, conversion) will contain its own `total` and `status` as well as the count for `successful` operations and `errors`.

When the asynchronous document query finishes, it stores new/updated document references for future requests and
updates the status of download to `completed`. Meanwhile, in the background, files will be converted and the convert count will be
incremented. Once all documents have been converted it too will be marked as `completed`.

If there's no document to be converted, the total will be set to zero and the status to `completed`.

Once each process completes, a webhook request will be sent to [your configured URL](/home/api-reference/settings/post-settings)
containing the available data. **Note:** the webhooks will only contain updates for new data fetched in the current document query.

Webhook message types - see [the respective section on the webhooks page](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks#patient-document-data)
for more details:

- `medical.document-download`: contains the newly downloaded documents for the patient;
- `medical.document-conversion`: result of converting the newly downloaded C-CDA documents into FHIR.

<Warning>
  If you were to trigger this endpoint again while the query is still processing, you will get a
  response that reflects the current query progress. So essentially, only a single document query
  will be running for a patient at any given time.
