title: "Start Document Query"
description: "Triggers a document query for the specified patient across HIEs."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/query"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous document query across HIEs. This is a two step process where the documents will
first be downloaded from the respective HIE and, if they are C-CDA/XML, then converted to FHIR.

Each process (download, conversion) will contain its own `total` and `status` as well as the count for `successful` operations and `errors`.

When the asynchronous document query finishes, it stores new/updated document references for future requests and
updates the status of download to `completed`. Meanwhile, in the background, files will be converted and the convert count will be
incremented. Once all documents have been converted it too will be marked as `completed`.

If there's no document to be converted, the total will be set to zero and the status to `completed`.

<Tip>
  To get updates about the document query progress, including download and conversion status, check
  out our [webhooks guide](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks). Note that the webhooks will only
  contain updates for new data fetched in the current document query.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you were to trigger this endpoint again while the query is still processing, you will get a
  response that reflects the current query progress. So essentially, only a single document query
  will be running for a patient at any given time.
