title: "Get Patient Settings"
description: "Returns aggregated monitoring settings for a patient based on all cohorts they belong to. 
When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts with conflicting settings, the least restrictive option is applied (logical OR). 
For cadence settings, the shortest interval is applied. For more information, 
see the [guide about Cohorts](/medical-api/handling-data/cohorts)"
api: "GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}/settings"

## Settings Aggregation Logic

When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts, their settings are aggregated from all cohorts 
they belong to. If there are conflicting settings between cohorts, the least restrictive option is applied (logical OR).

### Examples

**Patient in one cohort with ADT monitoring enabled:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, all with ADT monitoring enabled:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, one with ADT enabled, one disabled:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, one with weekly HIE, one with monthly HIE:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "hie": {
        "enabled": true,
        "frequency": "weekly"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
