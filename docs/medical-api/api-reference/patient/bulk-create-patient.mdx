title: "Bulk Patient Create"
description: "Creates a batch of patients in Metriport and initiates Document Queries for all of them."
api: "POST /medical/v1/patient/bulk"
---

The Bulk Patient Create endpoint allows you to create and kick off Document Queries for a batch of
Patients in a single request.

<Tip>
  Currently, a max of 100,000 patients in a batch is
  supported.
</Tip>

<Info>
  This is an asynchronous endpoint: you upload a file with
  patient demographics, and we notify you when the process
  is completed through a [webhook
  message](#webhook-with-the-result).

The response to this endpoint contains a URL that you should use to upload a file containing the
Patient demographics that will be used to create individual Patients. More on this
[below](#uploading-the-csv).

### Input CSV File Format

The file with the patient demographics should be created as comma-separated values, CSV. You can
access an example of the file
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cftXTyN2XFMGBwLHvPQuS5xkGXev1qZTXm49jslt6-4/edit?usp=sharing).

We support up to 10 addresses, 10 email addresses, and 10 phone numbers. In order to provide those,
just index each column with `-N` at the end of the column name, where `N` is the index (1-10).

<Warning> Column headers are <strong>case sensitive</strong>. Be sure to match them <em>exactly</em> 
as shown in the example file, otherwise the row may be marked as invalid. </Warning>

<Expandable title="CSV columns">
  <Info>
    You may provide a comma/space delimited string to
    specify multiple first and last names. For example, the
    following inputs would be equivalent: `"John,Jonathan"`
    & `"John Jonathan"` - these would translate to `["John",
    "Jonathan"]`.

**Example**

The first Patient below has two email addresses, the second Patient only has one email, and the
third Patient has three email addresses:

| ... | zip\* | email-1          | email-2             | email-3           | ... |
| --- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --- |
| ... | 12345 | some@domain.com  | another@domain.com  |                   | ... |
| ... | 12312 | avocado@food.com |                     |                   | ... |
| ... | 99887 | lawyer@job.com   | personal@domain.com | family@domain.com | ... |

For address fields, they work as a group: if you provide `addressLine1-2`, then all address fields
with index `2` are required (otherwise, the respective row/Patient will be marked as invalid).
Following this logic, if you don't provide any address field for index `3` through `10`, all the
address fields for those indexes are disconsidered, and the Patient is considered valid (assuming
other non-address fields are valid too).

At least one complete address must be provided:

- addressLine1-1
- addressLine2-1
- city-1
- state-1
- zip-1

For information about the result file, see [this](/medical-api/handling-data/webhooks#result-csv-file).

### Validation

This endpoint validates access to the provided Facility ID (or that there's only one if omitted).
It will return a `404` if the facility can't be found or `400` if there's more than one Facility
and the ID was not provided.

Once the CSV is uploaded, the Metriport API will also validate the file is in the expected format
(CSV). It might set the status of the request to `failed` and send a corresponding webhook message.

If those previous validations are successful, each row will be validated individually and it's
respective status will be stored so it can be reviewed in the
[result CSV file](/medical-api/handling-data/webhooks#result-csv-file) (it won't fail the whole
request at this point).

### Uploading the CSV

The URL is pre-signed to your account and has a duration of 10 minutes. It should only be used
once. Use it to send a `PUT` request like so:

```shell
curl --location --request PUT '<UPLOAD-URL>' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/csv' \
--header 'x-api-key: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
--data-binary '@/local-to-your/file.csv'
```

#### Webhook with the result

Once the CSV file is uploaded, the Metriport API starts processing it and sends a
[webhook message](/medical-api/handling-data/webhooks#bulk-patient-create) to your App
indicating the status is `processing`. Once the patiets are created and their medical
data is available, we send a new webhook message indicating the request is done, including
a link to the resulting CSV file that contains the newly created Metriport IDs for the
successfully created Patients.

#### Bulk Patient Create Status

During the processing of a bulk patient create, the request can change status following the logic
below:

[comment]: # (replace the image w/ the Mermaid diagram)

{/* TODO 2330 Add here the dotted link from processing to waiting when dryRun */}

<img src="/images/bulk-import-status.png" />

[comment]: # (mermaid --- flowchart LR     A["waiting"] --> B["processing"] & C["failed"] & D["expired"]      B --> E["completed"] )

- `waiting`: initial state, waiting for the CSV file;
- `processing`: the CSV file has been uploaded and is being processed;
- `completed`: the bulk create is completed;
- `failed`: the bulk create failed (likely due to an uploaded file with invalid format);
- `expired`: no file has been uploaded and the upload URL expired.

## Query Params

<ParamField query="facilityId" type="string">

</ParamField>

<ParamField query="dryRun" type="boolean">
  When set to `true`, no Patients will be created, and this

  feedback about each Patient demographics. Defaults to
  `false`.
</ParamField>
