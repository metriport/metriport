title: "Get Patient Settings"
description: "Returns aggregated monitoring settings for a patient based on all cohorts they belong to. When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts with conflicting settings, the more restrictive option is applied (logical AND). For cadence settings, the longest interval is applied.

const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");

const patientSettings = await metriport.getPatientSettings("018a80c4-292a-7486-a1234-76yuhe23yu14");
```

</ResponseExample>

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "hie": "monthly",
      "adt": true,
      "pharmacy": false,
      "laboratory": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Settings Aggregation Logic

When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts, their settings are aggregated from all cohorts they belong to. If there are conflicting settings between cohorts, the more restrictive option is applied (logical AND).

### Examples

**Patient in one cohort with ADT monitoring enabled:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, all with ADT monitoring enabled:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, one with ADT enabled, one disabled:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "adt": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, one with weekly HIE, one with monthly HIE:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "monitoring": {
      "hie": "monthly"
    }
  }
}
```
