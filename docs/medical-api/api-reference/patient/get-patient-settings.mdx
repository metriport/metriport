title: "Get Patient Settings"
description: "Returns aggregated settings for a patient based on all cohorts they belong to. When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts with conflicting settings, a logical AND operation is applied."
api: "GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}/settings"
---

## Path Params

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the patient whose settings are to be returned.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="settings" type="object" required>
  The aggregated settings for the patient based on their cohort memberships.
  <Expandable title="Settings properties">
    <ResponseField name="adtMonitoring" type="boolean" optional>
      Whether ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) monitoring is enabled for this patient. If the patient belongs to multiple cohorts with different ADT monitoring settings, this will be `true` only if ALL cohorts have it enabled (logical AND operation).

</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```javascript Metriport SDK
import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";

const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");

const patientSettings = await metriport.getPatientSettings("018a80c4-292a-7486-a1234-76yuhe23yu14");
```

</ResponseExample>

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "adtMonitoring": true
  }
}
```

## Settings Aggregation Logic

When a patient belongs to multiple cohorts:

- **Single cohort has setting**: The setting value is used
- **Multiple cohorts with same setting**: The setting value is used  
- **Multiple cohorts with conflicting settings**: Logical AND is applied (both must be `true` for result to be `true`)

### Examples

**Patient in one cohort with ADT monitoring enabled:**
```json
{ "adtMonitoring": true }
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, all with ADT monitoring enabled:**
```json
{ "adtMonitoring": true }
```

**Patient in multiple cohorts, one with ADT enabled, one disabled:**
```json
{ "adtMonitoring": false }
```
