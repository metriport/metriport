This is a paginated endpoint. For more information see [pagination](/medical-api/handling-data/pagination).

## Query Params

<ParamField query="filter" type="string" Optional>
  How to filter network entries. It uses Metriport's [filter/search criteria](/medical-api/handling-data/filters)
  based on the main properties of a Network: the organization's name, address, oid and root organization. Any search terms you use search across all of these fields.

One can combine fields as needed, for example:

- `metriport or sutter` will return all networks at least one of `metriport` or `sutter` in their data.
- `metriport -market` will return all networks with `metriport` in their data but _without_ `market` in their data.
- `metriport 150` will return all networks with `metriport` and the number `150` in their data, such as metriport with an address at `150 Market Street`.

</ParamField>
<Tip>
  The filters are _not_ case sensitive, but do match only against full words. i.e.
  `acme` will find `Acme Health Network`, while `Acm` will not.
</Tip>

## Response
