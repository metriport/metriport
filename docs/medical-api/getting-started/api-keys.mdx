## Overview

On the [Metriport Developer Dashboard](https://dash.metriport.com/developers), we support generating API keys.

For your security, read through this page to understand how to use them.

<Warning>
  If you believe any of your keys have been compromised, you can always revoke them on the Settings
  page by clicking the trash button beside the key. This will make the key inactive immediately, and
  you'll need to subsequenly generate a new one.
</Warning>

## The API Key

The API Key will give you full access to the Metriport API. This key has the
ability to perform destructive operations, and as such, we recommend treating it with the same
care as your account password.

Generally, this key should only be used in your backend services, not shared with anyone,
and never exposed in plain text.

<Warning>
  As you probably know, don't commit this key in plain text to your repositories either - even if
  your repos are private.
</Warning>
