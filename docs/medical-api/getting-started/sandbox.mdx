# Overview

Metriport offers a Sandbox environment so you can develop your medical applications more easily. This environment
allows you to try out the Medical API with some example de-identified clinical data (see section below for more details).

After you get access to the Medical API, you can go to the Developers page and toggle the switch under the Sandbox section to
activate Sandbox mode.

## Example Clinical Data

The Sandbox environment will give you access to comprehensive example clinical data for several
test patients - this data will be representative of what you can expect to see in production:

- C-CDA documents in XML format.
- FHIR resources in JSON format.
- Various de-identified unstructured clinical documents in PDF format.
- Various de-identified images in formats like TIFF and JPEG.

To access this data, you just need to create Patients that match some pre-defined
demographics.

<Warning>
  In Sandbox mode, any Patient you create with a **first
  name** that matches one of the pre-defined Patients below
  will be populated with the corresponding test data.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  When querying for consolidated data in sandbox mode using
  a `conversionType`, if you pass a patient that is not one
  of the pre-defined Patients below, we will always return a
  pre-defined file.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  You can expect about 6 example documents per Patient,
  roughtly breaking down to: a C-CDA XML (and the resulting
  FHIR resources), 3 PDFs, and 2 images.
</Tip>

The sections below will describe the pre-defined Patient demographics which you can use
as a base for requests to the [create Patient endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient):
