  icon="user"
  href="https://dash.metriport.com/"
>
  This will take you to the Metriport developer dashboard where you can create your Metriport
  account, if you don't have one already.
</Card>

---

## 2. Request API access

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to request API access:

- In the left hand menu, click `Products & Billing`.
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product.
- Fill out the form, and click `Request Access` to submit the request.

Once the form is submitted, we will review your request promptly and contact you if we need any further information.

---

## 3. Generate an API key

After we approve your access request, take the following steps to get your API key:

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to get your API key:

- In the left hand menu, click "Products & Billing".
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product, and add your payment info.
- In the left hand menu, click `Developers`.
- On the Developers page, you'll be able to click the "Generate Secret Key" button.

<Info>
  This Secret Key will allow you to start making requests to the entire Metriport API on your
  behalf. Treat this like a password, and keep it somewhere safe! You can read the [API
  Keys](/home/api-info/api-keys) page to learn more about API key security best practices.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If you believe your key has been compromised, you can always revoke it and then generate a new one
  on the Developers page by clicking the trash button beside the key.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  After you get access to the Medical API, you can go to the Developers page and toggle the switch
  under the `Sandbox` section. Learn more about it [here](/medical-api/more-info/sandbox).

</Tip>

## 4. Integrate your app with Metriport

Note that there are two ways to receive data from Metriport:

- Webhook: Metriport sends patient data to your app when it becomes available:
  - your application exposes a webhook (endpoint), which Metriport calls when there's Patient data available after initiating a query;
  - to learn more about how the Webhook flow works, see [our Webhooks guide](/home/api-info/webhooks).
- API: Your app requests data from Metriport:
  - your application polls Metriport for Patients' medical data after initiating a query to fetch a Patient's documents;

<Tip>
  We recommend using Webhooks to ensure you're able to get patient data as quickly and easily as
  possible.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Register your Organization

<Info>
  For the remainder of the steps, you are able to either use the Dashboard UI, or the API - whatever
  you prefer!
</Info>

<Info>
  Pro-tip: you can use our handy [SDK](/medical-api/more-info/sdk) on your server
  if you're using Node:

  <Snippet file="medical-api-init.mdx" />
</Info>

First, you'll need to register an `Organization` in Metriport.

<Info>
  An `Organization` represents your company's legal corporate entity - this is needed for HIPAA
  auditing purposes so the Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) can validate who is making requests
  to the networks.
</Info>

You only need to register your `Organization` once, and you can do so by either:

### Using the API

See the [Create Organization endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization) in our API reference.

### Using the Dashboard

- In the left hand menu, click `Medical API`.
- In the Organization section, click `Create`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to register your Organization.

---

## 6. Create Facilities and Patients

Once your Organization is registered, you can now create `Facilities` and `Patients`. First,
you'll need to create your `Facilities`.

<Info>
  In Metriport, a `Facility` is a location that a `Patient` receives some form of treatment. You can
  create multiple `Facilities` to represent each of your care locations. Note that for telehealth
  practices, these can be virtual locations.
</Info>

You can create a `Facility` by either:

### Creating Facilities using the API

See the [Create Facility endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/facility/create-facility) in our API reference.

### Creating Facilities using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Add`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Facility.

Once you've created all of your `Facilities`, you can create the `Patients` that you treat
each facility. You can create `Patients` by either:

### Creating Patients using the API

See the [Create Patient endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) in our API reference.

### Creating Patients using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Patients` for the Facility under which to add Patients.
- In the Patients section, click `Add`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Patient.

<Info>
  When you create a Patient, Metriport automatically links the Patient to all HIE data sources
  related to the Patient based on the demographic and/or identification information provided when
  creating the Patient.
</Info>

---

## 7. Get Patient Medical Documents

Now, you're able to access your Patients' medical `Documents`. This involves 2 main steps:

1. Querying for available `Documents` to get a list of metadata describing the available records.
2. Downloading the `Document` data from the URL returned in the metadata.

To query for a Patient's available `Documents`, you can either:

### Query for Documents using the API

1. Start an asynchronous [Document Query](/medical-api/api-reference/document/start-document-query) across HIEs;
1. Then, either process the inbound [Webhook message](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks) which will be sent if you
   have Webhooks configured, or poll the API to [List Documents](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents) to get
   the available document references returned from HIEs.

### Query for Documents using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Patients` for the Facility where the Patient is located.
- In the desired Patient's row, click `Documents`.
- You'll see all available Documents in the side panel.
- To update the list of documents from HIEs, click on `Query Documents`.

<Info>Not all Patients will have available Documents, but they should ~95% of the time.</Info>

Once you've identified the `Document` you want to retrieve, you can download them by either:

### Downloading a Document using the API

See the [Get Document endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/get-document) in our API reference.

### Downloading a Document using the Dashboard

- In the side panel that comes up after clicking `Documents`, simply click `Download` on the desired Document.

## 8. Get Patient FHIR Resources 🎉🎉🎉

As we query for Documents we will automatically convert XML C-CDA docs into FHIR resources.

<Tip>
  Other Documents, like PDFs and images, will be left in their original format and not processed.
</Tip>

After the conversion from CDA to FHIR, we will store the resulting FHIR resources and make them available to be queried.
This will allow you to get the necessary data you might need to better understand and treat your Patients.

To learn more on how to obtain a Patient's resources, please see the [Start Consolidated
Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post) endpoint.

We also provide the ability to add any FHIR resources to a Patient with our [Create Patient's Consolidated
Data](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/create-patient-consolidated) endpoint.

## 9. Generate Patient Medical Record Summary ⭐⭐⭐

The aforementioned FHIR resources are generated from all available CDAs for a patient, resulting in a set of unique medical records. To condense all of these records into a single document, you can follow these steps:

- kick off a [Consolidated Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post).

This route allows you to choose what FHIR resources and what date range you want to include into the summary. When this query completes, a webhook with a JSON payload containing all these resources will be sent to you.

- monitor the status of the query using the [Get Consolidated Data Query Status](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-get) endpoint.

- check when the Medical Record Summary was created in either PDF or HTML format using the [Get Medical Record Summary Status](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/get-medical-record-summary-status) endpoint.

- download the Medical Record Summary in a PDF or HTML format using the [Get Medical Record Summary](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/get-medical-record-summary) endpoint.

## 10. Share Medical Data with the Networks 🚀🚀🚀

To uphold data quality in the networks, and improve patient health outcomes, it's required that your organization reciprocates medical data exchange by making net-new patient clinical data available to the networks. Some examples of this include:

- remote patient monitoring observations such as weight and blood pressure;
- clinical progress notes from patient encounters;
- lab results

Metriport makes it easy to share this data back with the networks - you can:

- upload FHIR data using our [Create Patient's Consolidated Data](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/create-patient-consolidated) endpoint.
- upload binary documents using the [Upload Document](/medical-api/api-reference/document/post-upload-url) endpoint.

## Wrapping up

That's it! You're now well equiped to use the Metriport API to access and manage your Patients' medical data.

As next steps, we'd recommend scoping out our [Medical API Reference](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization)
in further detail to see the other things you can do with the API.
