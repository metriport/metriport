## Overview

Getting started with our Medical API is pretty easy, you'll just need take the following steps:

1. [Create a developer account](#1-create-a-developer-account).
2. [Request API access](#2-request-api-access).
3. [Generate an API key](#3-generate-an-api-key).
4. [Register your Organization](#4-register-your-organization).
5. [Create Facilities and Patients](#5-create-facilities-and-patients).
6. [Get Patient Medical Documents](#6-get-patient-medical-documents). 🎉🎉🎉

Let's get into it! 🤘

## 1. Create a developer account

<Card
  title="Click me to go to the developer dashboard!"
  icon="user"
  href="https://dash.metriport.com/"
>
  This will take you to the Metriport developer dashboard where you can create your Metriport
  account, if you don't have one already.
</Card>

## 2. Request API access

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to request API access:

- In the left hand menu, click `Products & Billing`.
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product.
- Fill out the form, and click `Request Access` to submit the request.

Once the form is submitted, we will review your request promptly and contact you if we need any further information.

## 3. Generate an API key

After we approve your access request, take the following steps to get your API key:

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to get your API key:

- In the left hand menu, click "Products & Billing".
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product, and add your payment info.
- In the left hand menu, click `Developers`.
- On the Developers page, you'll be able to click the "Generate Secret Key" button.

<Info>
  This Secret Key will allow you to start making requests to the entire Metriport API on your
  behalf. Treat this like a password, and keep it somewhere safe! You can read the [API
  Keys](/home/api-info/api-keys) page to learn more about API key security best practices.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If you believe your key has been compromised, you can always revoke it and then generate a new one
  on the Developers page by clicking the trash button beside the key.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  After you get access to the Medical API, you can go to the Developers page and toggle the switch
  under the `Sandbox` section. Learn more about it [here](/medical-api/more-info/sandbox).

</Tip>

## 4. Register your Organization

<Info>
  For the remainder of the steps, you are able to either use the Dashboard UI, or the API - whatever
  you prefer!
</Info>

<Info>
  Pro-tip: you can use our handy [SDK](/medical-api/more-info/sdk) on your server
  if you're using Node:

  <Snippet file="medical-api-init.mdx" />
</Info>

First, you'll need to register an `Organization` in Metriport.

<Info>
  An `Organization` represents your company's legal corporate entity - this is needed for HIPAA
  auditing purposes so the Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) can validate who is making requests
  to the networks.
</Info>

You only need to register your `Organization` once, and you can do so by either:

### Using the API

See the [Create Organization endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization) in our API reference.

### Using the Dashboard

- In the left hand menu, click `Medical API`.
- In the Organization section, click `Create`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to register your Organization.

## 5. Create Facilities and Patients

Once your Organization is registered, you can now create `Facilities` and `Patients`. First,
you'll need to create your `Facilities`.

<Info>
  In Metriport, a `Facility` is a location that a `Patient` receives some form of treatment. You can
  create multiple `Facilities` to represent each of your care locations. Note that for telehealth
  practices, these can be virtual locations.
</Info>

You can create a `Facility` by either:

### Creating Facilities using the API

See the [Create Facility endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/facility/create-facility) in our API reference.

### Creating Facilities using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Add`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Facility.

Once you've created all of your `Facilities`, you can create the `Patients` that you treat
each facility. You can create `Patients` by either:

### Creating Patients using the API

See the [Create Patient endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) in our API reference.

### Creating Patients using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Patients` for the Facility under which to add Patients.
- In the Patients section, click `Add`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Patient.

<Info>
  When you create a Patient, Metriport automatically links the Patient to all HIE data sources
  related to the Patient based on the demographic and/or identification information provided when
  creating the Patient.
</Info>

## 6. Get Patient Medical Documents 🎉🎉🎉

Now, you're able to access your Patients' medical `Documents`. This involves 2 main steps:

1. Querying for available `Documents` to get a list of metadata describing the available records.
2. Downloading the `Document` data from the URL returned in the metadata.

To query for a Patient's available `Documents`, you can either:

### Query for Documents using the API

See the [List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents) in our API reference.

### Query for Documents using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Patients` for the Facility where the Patient is located.
- In the desired Patient's row, click `Documents`.
- You'll see all available Documents in the side panel.

<Info>Not all Patients will have available Documents, but they should ~95% of the time.</Info>

Once you've identified the `Document` you want to retrieve, you can download them by either:

### Downloading a Document using the API

See the [Get Document endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/get-document) in our API reference.

### Downloading a Document using the Dashboard

- In the side panel that comes up after clicking `Documents`, simply click `Download` on the desired Document.

That's it! You're now well equiped to use the Metriport API to access and manage your Patients' medical data.

As next steps, we'd recommend scoping out our [Medical API Reference](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization)
in further detail to see the other things you can do with the API.
