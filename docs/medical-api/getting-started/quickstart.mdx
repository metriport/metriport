## Overview

Getting started with our Medical API is pretty easy, you'll just need take the following steps:

1. [Create a developer account](#1-create-a-developer-account).
1. [Generate an API key](#2-generate-an-api-key).
1. [Integrate your app with Metriport](#3-integrate-your-app-with-metriport).
1. [Create Facilities and Patients](#4-create-facilities-and-patients).
1. [Query for Patient Documents](#5-query-for-patient-documents).
1. [Get Patient Medical Data](#6-get-patient-medical-data).
1. [Contribute Medical Data](#7-contribute-medical-data).
1. [Request API access](#8-request-api-access).


Let's get into it! ðŸ¤˜

## 1. Create a developer account

<Snippet file="create-dev-account.mdx" />

---

## 2. Generate an API key

After we approve your access request, take the following steps to get your API key:

- Toggle the `Sandbox` switch in the Dashboard navbar to enter `Sandbox` mode (learn more about this
  [here](/medical-api/getting-started/sandbox)).
- In the left hand menu, click `Developers`.
- On the Developers page, you'll be able to click the `Generate API Key` button.

<Warning>
  The API key will only be displayed once. Please make sure to save it to a secure location before
  leaving the page.
</Warning>

This API Key will allow you to start making requests to the entire Metriport API on your
behalf. Treat this like a password, and keep it somewhere safe! You can read the [API
Keys](/medical-api/getting-started/api-keys) page to learn more about API key security best practices.

<Tip>
  If you believe your key has been compromised, you can always revoke it and then generate a new one
  on the Developers page by clicking the trash button beside the key.
</Tip>

## 3. Integrate your app with Metriport

Note that there are two ways to receive data from Metriport:

- Webhook: Metriport sends patient data to your app when it becomes available:
  - your application exposes a webhook (endpoint), which Metriport calls when there's Patient data available after initiating a query;
  - to learn more about how the Webhook flow works, see [our Webhooks guide](/medical-api/getting-started/webhooks).
- API: Your app requests data from Metriport:
  - your application polls Metriport for Patients' medical data after initiating a query to fetch a Patient's documents;

<Tip>
  We recommend using Webhooks to ensure you're able to get patient data as quickly and easily as
  possible.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Create Facilities and Patients

<Info>
  For the remainder of the steps, you are able to either use the Dashboard UI, or the API - whatever
  you prefer!
</Info>

<Info>
  Pro-tip: you can use our handy [SDK](/medical-api/api-tools/sdk) on your server
  if you're using Node:

  <Snippet file="medical-api-init.mdx" />
</Info>

Now you can now create `Facilities` and `Patients`. First,
you'll need to create your `Facilities`.

<Info>
  In Metriport, a `Facility` is a location that a `Patient` receives some form of treatment. You can
  create multiple `Facilities` to represent each of your care locations. Note that for telehealth
  practices, these can be virtual locations.
</Info>

<Tip>In Sandbox mode, you can use the test NPI `1234567893` when creating Facilities.</Tip>

You can create a `Facility` by either:

### Creating Facilities using the API

See the [Create Facility endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/facility/create-facility) in our API reference.

### Creating Facilities using the Dashboard

- On the `Facilities` page, click `Create Facility`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Facility.

Once you've created all of your `Facilities`, you can create the `Patients` that you treat in each facility.

<Tip>
  In Sandbox mode, you can create Patients with pre-defined patient demographics to simulate a match
  and pull example clinical data - see our [Sandbox
  guide](/medical-api/getting-started/sandbox#example-clinical-data) for more details.
</Tip>

You can create `Patients` by either:

### Creating Patients using the API

See the [Create Patient endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) in our API reference.

### Creating Patients using the Dashboard

- On the `Patients` page, click `Create Patient`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Patient.

<Info>
  When you create a Patient, Metriport automatically links the Patient to all HIE data sources
  related to the Patient based on the demographic and/or identification information provided when
  creating the Patient.
</Info>

---

## 5. Query for Patient Documents

Now, you're able to query for your Patients' medical `Documents` (outside medical records).

As we query for Documents, we automatically convert outside records (like XML C-CDA docs) into `FHIR` resources ðŸ”¥,
deduplicate the data, standardize it, enrich it with medical code lookups and crosswalks, and store the resulting data
on our servers for you to access at any time through a single endpoint.

To query for a Patient's available `Documents`, you can either:

### Query for Documents using the API

Start an asynchronous [Document Query](/medical-api/api-reference/document/start-document-query) to initiate a query for the Patient's medical documents from all external sources.

<Info>
  When this process completes, we'll send you a `medical.document-conversion` webhook - see [the respective section on the webhooks page](/medical-api/handling-data/webhooks#patient-document-data)
  for more details.
</Info>

<Info>
  If you don't have webhooks integrated, you can use the [Get Document Query Status](/medical-api/api-reference/document/get-document-query) endpoint to check the status of the query.
</Info>

### Query for Documents using the Dashboard

- On the `Patients` page, click on the desired Patient row to be taken to their interactive medical record chart summary page.
- If this is the first time viewing this Patient's chart, Metriport will automatically retrieve the Patient's medical documents from all external sources;
- Otherwise, you can click `Refresh Patient Data` anytime to get the latest medical documents from external sources.

<Info>Not all Patients will have available Documents, but they should ~95% of the time.</Info>

## 6. Get Patient Medical Data

The aforementioned deduplicated, standardized, and enriched `FHIR` data will allow you to get the source of truth for a Patient's medical data to better understand and treat your Patients.
We refer to this as `Consolidated Data` in Metriport.

<Tip>
  Read our [FHIR guide](/medical-api/fhir/overview) to learn more about how Metriport leverages FHIR.
</Tip>

To learn more on how to obtain a Patient's Consolidated data via API, please see the [Start Consolidated Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post) endpoint - 
note that this same data is also available via the Dashboard.

<Tip>
  To render this data in a single summary document, refer to the [Medical Record Summary](/medical-api/handling-data/medical-record-summary) guide.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  If you need to access the raw unprocessed Documents, see the [Start Bulk Get Document URL](/medical-api/api-reference/document/download-url-bulk) endpoint.
</Tip>

## 7. Contribute Medical Data

To uphold data quality with Metriport's data sources, and improve patient health outcomes, it's required that your organization reciprocates medical data exchange by making net-new patient clinical data available to the networks. Some examples of this include:

- Remote patient monitoring observations such as weight and blood pressure;
- Clinical progress notes from patient encounters;
- Lab results

Metriport makes it easy to contribute this data - you can:

- Upload FHIR data using our [Create Patient's Consolidated Data](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/create-patient-consolidated) endpoint.
- Upload binary documents using the [Upload Document](/medical-api/api-reference/document/post-upload-url) endpoint.

For more details on how to contribute data back, see the [Data Contribution](/medical-api/handling-data/contribution) guide.

## 8. Request API access

<Warning>
  Access to our Medical API will require you to make requests on behalf of a covered entity with an
  [NPI
  number](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand)
  for a valid
  [Treatment](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/disclosures-treatment-payment-health-care-operations/index.html)
  purpose of use.
</Warning>

To start using the Medical API for production workloads, with real patient data, you can take the following steps to request production API access:

- In the left hand menu, click `Products & Billing`.
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product.
- Press `Book an Intro Call` and select a time and a date to talk to us.

After the call, we will promptly setup your account.

## Wrapping up

That's it! ðŸ¤˜

You're now well equiped to use the Metriport API to access, manage, and exchange your Patients' medical data.

As next steps, we'd recommend scoping out our [Medical API Reference](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization)
