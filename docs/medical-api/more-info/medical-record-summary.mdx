This guide will teach you how to generate a Medical Record Summary, which condenses all of patients' medical records into a single document.

To do this, Metriport extracts FHIR resources across all available C-CDA documents for a patient and de-duplicates them, resulting in a set of unique medical records. These are then rendered as HTML or PDF files, making them extremely easy to navigate.

Here's the title page of an example Medical Record Summary:

## Generate using the API

To generate a Medical Record Summary using Metriport API:

1. Start a [Consolidated Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post). This endpoint allows you to optionally choose [FHIR resources](/medical-api/fhir/overview), date range, and rendering (`pdf` or `html`) for your Medical Record Summary.
1. When the file is rendered, a [webhook message with a downloadable URL](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks#medical-record) will be sent to you.

## Generate using the Dashboard

To generate a Medical Record Summary from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the patient's document section as follows:

<img className="h-100" src="/images/dashboard-patient.png" />

1. Select whether you want to download a new or a previously-generated (if such is available) Medical Record Summary
1. Click the button with the desired format to initiate the download.

<Warning>
  For patients with a large number of documents, this may take a few minutes to complete.
