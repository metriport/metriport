<Warning>
  The AI Brief feature is currently in Beta. While we strive for accuracy, these summaries should
  not be used as the sole source of truth for medical decision-making. We welcome your feedback to
  help us improve this feature.
</Warning>

The AI Brief feature summarizes your lengthiest patient records into one cohesive paragraph consisting of the most relevant medical history you need to know about your patient.

## API

When using the API, you can access the AI brief by triggering a [Consolidated Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post) request. Depending on the `conversionType` you choose, the AI brief will be included in the response in a different format.

### FHIR Bundle

When triggering a consolidated query via the API with the `conversionType` query param set to `json`, the AI brief will be included in the response under a [Binary resource](/medical-api/fhir/resources/binary) with the following format:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Binary",
  "id": "1234",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "lastUpdated": "2023-06-14T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "metriport:ai-generated-brief"
  },
  "contentType": "text/plain",
  // Base64 encoded string containing the AI brief text
  "data": "VGhlIHBhdGllbnQgaXMgYSA0Mi15ZWFyLW9sZCBtYWxlIHdobyBpcyBjdXJyZW50bHkgb24gbXVsdGlwbGUgbWVkaWNhdGlvbnMgdG8gbWFuYWdlCnZhcmlvdXMgY29uZGl0aW9ucy4gSGlzIG1lZGljYXRpb24gcmVnaW1lbiBpbmNsdWRlcyB6b2xwaWRlbSAxMCBtZyBmb3Igc2xlZXAsIHNpbXZhc3RhdGluCjIwIG1nIGZvciBjaG9sZXN0ZXJvbCBtYW5hZ2VtZW50LCBsZXZvdGh5cm94aW5lIHNvZGl1bSAwLjA3NSBtZyAoU3ludGhyb2lkKSBmb3IgdGh5cm9pZApyZXBsYWNlbWVudCB0aGVyYXB5LCBhbmQgemFmaXJsdWthc3QgMjAgbWcgKEFjY29sYXRlKSBmb3IgYXN0aG1hIG1hbmFnZW1lbnQuIFRoZQpjb21iaW5hdGlvbiBvZiB0aGVzZSBtZWRpY2F0aW9ucyBzdWdnZXN0cyB0aGUgcGF0aWVudCBoYXMgY29uY3VycmVudCBjb25kaXRpb25zCmluY2x1ZGluZyBzbGVlcCBkaXN0dXJiYW5jZSwgaHlwZXJjaG9sZXN0ZXJvbGVtaWEsIGh5cG90aHlyb2lkaXNtLCBhbmQgYXN0aG1hIG9yIG90aGVyCnJlc3BpcmF0b3J5IGlzc3VlcyByZXF1aXJpbmcgYSBsZXVrb3RyaWVuZSBtb2RpZmllci4="

### Medical Record Summary PDF

When triggering a consolidated query via the API with the `conversionType` query param set to `pdf`, the AI brief appears at the top of the Medical Record Summary PDF document.
