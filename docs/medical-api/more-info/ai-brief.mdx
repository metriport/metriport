<Warning>
  The AI Brief feature is currently in Beta. While we strive
  for accuracy, these summaries should not be used as the
  sole source of truth for medical decision-making. We
  welcome your feedback to help us improve this feature.
</Warning>

The AI Brief feature summarizes your lengthiest patient records into one cohesive paragraph consisting
of the most relevant medical history you need to know about your patient.

## API

When using the API, you can access the AI brief by triggering a
[Consolidated Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post) request.
Depending on the `conversionType` you choose, the AI brief will be included in the response in a
different format (see [FHIR Bundle](/medical-api/more-info/ai-brief#fhir-bundle) or
[Medical Record Summary](/medical-api/more-info/ai-brief#medical-record-summary) below).

<Tip>
  If you add a resource type filter to the `Consolidated
  Data Query`, make sure to include `Binary` as well in
  order to get the AI Brief in the results.
</Tip>

### FHIR Bundle

When triggering a consolidated query via the API with the `conversionType` query param set to `json`,
the AI brief will be included in the response under a
[Binary resource](/medical-api/fhir/resources/binary) with the following format:

<Info>
  The `data` field is a Base64 encoded string containing the
  AI brief text.
