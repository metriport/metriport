---

The AI Summary feature provides a concise, natural language overview of a patient's medical record history. It analyzes the available medical data and generates an easy-to-read narrative that highlights key medical events, conditions, and treatments. You can access AI summaries through either the API or the dashboard.

## API

When using the API, you can access the AI summary by triggering a [Consolidated Data Query Start](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post) request. Depending on the `conversionType` you choose, the AI summary will be included in the response in a different format.

### FHIR Bundle

When triggering a consolidated query via the API with `conversionType: "json"`, the AI summary will be included in the response under a [Binary resource](/medical-api/fhir/resources/binary).

The AI summary will be included in a Binary resource with the following format:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Binary",
  "id": "1234",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "lastUpdated": "2023-06-14T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "ai-generated-brief"
  },
  "contentType": "text/plain",
  "data": "dGVzdCBzdW1tYXJ5"
}
```

### MR Summary PDF

When triggering a consolidated query via the API with `conversionType: "pdf"`, the AI summary appears at the top of the Medical Record Summary PDF document.

## Dashboard

Once a patient's data is loaded in the Metriport dashboard, you can view their AI summary at the top of their medical record history.

## Beta Status

<Note>
  The AI Summary feature is currently in Beta. While we strive for accuracy, these summaries should
  not be used as the sole source of truth for medical decision-making. We welcome your feedback to
  help us improve this feature.
