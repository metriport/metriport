For developers who prefer to explore APIs using Postman, we provide a comprehensive Postman collection. This collection includes pre-configured requests for our API endpoints, making it easy to test and understand our API functionality.

You can access our Postman collection here:

Additionally, you can download the `collection.json` file directly from our GitHub repository:
