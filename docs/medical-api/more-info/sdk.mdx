description: "How to access the Medical API using our SDK"
---

We've developed an SDK to help you get access to our API without the HTTP plumbing. It's currently only available for
Node-based applications ([let us know](https://www.metriport.com/contact-us) what other languages you'd like to see it available on).

<Info>
  If you would like to generate your own SDK, you can use our [OpenAPI
  specification](/medical-api/more-info/open-api) to generate client libraries in any language that
  suits your project needs.
</Info>

The SDK is available as an NPM package and you can access it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metriport/api-sdk).

To install:

```shell
npm install --save @metriport/api-sdk
```

Initialize it like so:

<Snippet file="medical-api-init.mdx" />

Some examples of usage, once the API client is initialized:

```typescript
// Create a Facility
const patient = await metriportClient.createFacility({
  // facility data
});

// Get a Patient
const patient = await metriportClient.getPatient(patientId);

// List the given Patient's available documents/records
const documents = await metriportClient.listDocuments(patientId, facilityId);
```

The operations available follow the [API specification](/medical-api/api-reference/facility/create-facility),
with this pattern:

- `GET /` endpoints are exposed as `list<EntityNameInPlural>()`
- `GET /:id` endpoints are exposed as `get<EntityName>()`
- `POST /` endpoints are exposed as `create<EntityName>()`
- `PUT /:id` endpoints are exposed as `update<EntityName>()`
- `DELETE /:id` endpoints are exposed as `remove<EntityName>()`

The client source code contains only the exposed operations and is available
[here](https://github.com/metriport/metriport/blob/develop/packages/api-sdk/src/medical/client/metriport.ts).
