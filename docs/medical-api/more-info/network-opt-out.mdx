Health Information Exchange (HIE) networks allow healthcare providers to share patient information securely. However, patients have the right to opt out of these networks if they wish to maintain stricter control over their health data. This guide will walk you through the process of opting a patient out of HIE networks using our dashboard.

## Opt Out from the Dashboard

To opt out from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the patient's page by selecting a patient from the list:

Once a patient has been opted out, it's crucial to understand that the patient's health information will no longer be accessible through HIE networks.
