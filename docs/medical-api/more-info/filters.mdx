Some features include the ability to filter data. In those cases, the syntax below can be used:
- `unquoted text`: all words are required to be present in the results, in any order.
- `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be expected to be included in the results as provided.
- `or`: allows for optional words/parameter.
- `-`: excludes the word/parameter following the minus sign.

Examples:
- `"jonh doe"`: returns entries including `john doe` in this order.
- `john doe`: returns entries including `john` and `doe` in any order; e.g., `john doe`, `john gray doe`, or `doe john`, but not
  those with only `john` or `doe`.
- `john or doe`: returns entries including `john` or `doe`; e.g., `john`, `doe`, `john doe`, `doe john`, `doe gray john`.
- `john -doe`: returns entries including `john` without any `doe` on it.
