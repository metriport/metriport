description: "Comprehensive guide to Metriport's API structure, including schemas, endpoints, and integration tools"

Our OpenAPI specification defines the structure of our API, including endpoints, request/response formats, and available operations.

You can find our OpenAPI definition in our GitHub repository:

## Custom SDK Generation

One of the key advantages of our OpenAPI specification is the ability to generate custom SDKs in various programming languages. While we provide an official SDK for TypeScript, you can use the OpenAPI specification to generate client libraries in any language that suits your project needs.
