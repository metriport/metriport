Metriport's Salesforce Health Cloud app enables seamless access to patient health data directly within the Salesforce Health Cloud workflow through an embedded application. The embedded app provides access to all health data available via Metriport's dashboard and API, including the ability to initiate new Document Queries.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport Salesforce Health Cloud app, contact our team at [support@metriport.com](mailto:support@metriport.com).

## How it Works

Patients can be created in Metriport via the following workflow:

1. When a Salesforce Health Cloud user opens the embedded Metriport app on a patient's chart for the first time, Metriport creates the patient if they don't already exist.
2. After creation, Metriport automatically triggers a Document Query to begin gathering available health data.

Once a patient is created, you can access their comprehensive medical history by navigating to your Apps and selecting the Metriport app. This opens the app.
