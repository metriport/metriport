Metriport's Athena app enables seamless access to patient health data directly within the Athena EHR workflow through an embedded application in the patient's Chart. The embedded app provides access to all health data available via Metriport's dashboard and API, including the ability to initiate new Document Queries.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport Athena embedded app in your practices, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Athena Marketplace](https://marketplace.athenahealth.com/) and locate the Metriport app
2. Click "Contact Partner" to initiate the integration process
3. Metriport Team will provide you with the Authorization & Consent form link
4. Submit the completed form to Athena at marketplace@athenahealth.com

Once approved, the Metriport app will be available within your Athena EHR workflow.

## How it Works

Patients can be created in Metriport through two automated workflows:

1. **Manual Creation**: When an Athena user opens the Metriport embedded app on a patient's Chart for the first time, it triggers a one-time creation flow if the patient doesn't already exist in Metriport.

2. **Appointment-Based Creation**: When an appointment is scheduled for an Athena patient, Metriport's backend automatically creates the patient during a background cycle that runs every 15 minutes.

In both cases, a Document Query is automatically triggered after patient creation to begin gathering available health data.

Once a patient is created, you can access their comprehensive medical history by clicking the "Apps" button and selecting the Metriport app. This opens an iframe displaying the patient's complete Metriport record, including all available health data.
