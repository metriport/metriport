Metriport's eClinicalWorks app enables seamless access to patient health data directly within the eClinicalWorks workflow through an embedded application. The embedded app provides access to all health data available via Metriport's dashboard and API, including the ability to initiate new Document Queries.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport eClinicalWorks app, please reach out to support@metriport.com

## How it Works

Patients can be created in Metriport through via the following workflow:

1. **Manual Creation**: When the eClinicalWorks user opens the Metriport embedded app on a patient's Chart for the first time, it triggers a one-time creation flow if the patient doesn't already exist in Metriport.

Document Query is automatically triggered after patient creation to begin gathering available health data.

Once a patient is created, you can access their comprehensive medical history by navigating to your Apps and selecting the Metriport app. This opens the app.
