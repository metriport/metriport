Metriport's Elation app streamlines access to comprehensive patient health records by adding a convenient button directly in the patient's Chart within Elation EHR. When clicked, this button opens a new tab taking you directly to the patient's complete medical history in the Metriport dashboard.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport Elation app in your practices, contact our team at [support@metriport.com](mailto:support@metriport.com). We'll work with you to:

1. Set up the app in your Elation instance
2. Configure the button placement in your patient Charts
3. Enable single sign-on between Elation and Metriport

Once configured, the Metriport button will be available within your Elation EHR workflow, allowing quick access to comprehensive patient records.

## How it Works

The Elation app automatically checks for patients with scheduled appointments in the next two weeks every 15 minutes. For each patient found:

1. A new patient record is created in Metriport
2. A Document Query is initiated to gather available health data
3. A link to the Metriport dashboard is added to their Elation patient profile, allowing direct access to their comprehensive medical history

<Warning>
  To successfully create patients in Metriport, the
  patient's demographics in Elation must include both an
  address and ZIP code. Patients missing this information
  will not be synchronized.

<Warning>
  Data write-back functionality to Elation is currently in
  development. Contact us for more information about
  upcoming features and app capabilities.
