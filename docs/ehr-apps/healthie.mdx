Metriport's Healthie app streamlines access to comprehensive patient health records by adding a convenient link directly in the patient's Quick Notes within Healthie EHR. When clicked, this button opens a new tab taking you directly to the patient's complete medical history in the Metriport dashboard.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport Healthie app in your practices, contact our team at support@metriport.com. We'll work with you to:

1. Set up the app in your Healthie instance
2. Configure the button placement in your patient Charts
3. Enable single sign-on between Healthie and Metriport

Once configured, the Metriport button will be available within your Healthie EHR workflow, allowing quick access to comprehensive patient records.

## How it Works

The Healthie app automatically checks for patients with scheduled appointments in the next two weeks every 15 minutes. For each patient found:

1. A new patient record is created in Metriport
2. A Document Query is initiated to gather available health data
3. A link to the Metriport dashboard is added to their Healthie patient profile, allowing direct access to their comprehensive medical history

<Warning>
  To successfully create patients in Metriport, the
  patient's demographics in Healthie must include both an
  address and zip code. Patients missing this information
  will not be synchronized.
