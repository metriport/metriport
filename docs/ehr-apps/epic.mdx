Metriport's Epic app enables seamless access to patient health data directly within the Epic workflow through an embedded application. The embedded app provides access to all health data available via Metriport's dashboard and API, including the ability to initiate new Document Queries.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport Epic app, contact our team at [support@metriport.com](mailto:support@metriport.com).

## How it Works

Patients can be created in Metriport via the following workflow:

1. When an Epic user opens the embedded Metriport app on a patient's chart for the first time, Metriport creates the patient if they don't already exist.
2. Once a patient is created, you can access their comprehensive medical history by navigating to the Metriport app.

Once a patient is created, you can access their comprehensive medical history by navigating to Metriport app.
