## Notes

### Garmin

Garmin is only supported through [webhooks](/more-info/webhooks).

As of now, our Garmin integration only supports new data - there's no option to
"backfill"/request a users' past data. [Let us know](mailto:contact@metriport.com) about
your use case if that's something you're looking for.
