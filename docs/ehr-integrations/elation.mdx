Metriport's Elation integration streamlines access to comprehensive patient health records by adding a convenient button directly in the patient's Chart within Elation EHR. When clicked, this button opens a new tab taking you directly to the patient's complete medical history in the Metriport dashboard.

## Getting Started

To enable the Metriport Elation integration in your practices, contact our team at support@metriport.com. We'll work with you to:

1. Set up the integration in your Elation instance
2. Configure the button placement in your patient Charts
3. Enable single sign-on between Elation and Metriport

Once configured, the Metriport button will be available within your Elation EHR workflow, allowing quick access to comprehensive patient records.

## How it Works

The Elation integration automatically checks for patients with scheduled appointments in the next two weeks every 15 minutes. For each patient found:

1. A new patient record is created in Metriport
2. A Document Query is initiated to gather available health data
3. A link to the Metriport dashboard is added to their Elation patient profile, allowing direct access to their comprehensive medical history

<Warning>
  To successfully create patients in Metriport, the patient's demographics in Elation must include
  both an address and zip code. Patients missing this information will not be synchronized.

  Data write-back functionality to Elation is currently in development. Contact us for more
  information about upcoming features and integration capabilities.
