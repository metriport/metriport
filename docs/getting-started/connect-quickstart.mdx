## Overview

Getting started with Metriport is pretty easy, you'll just need take the following steps:

1. Create a developer account.
2. Generate an API key.
3. Setup the Metriport client on your server.
4. Link to the Metriport Connect widget in your app.
5. Access your users' health data ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Let's get into it! ðŸ¤˜

## 1. Create a developer account

<Card
  title="Click me to go to the developer dashboard!"
  icon="user"
  href="https://dash.metriport.com/"
>
  This will take you to the Metriport developer dashboard where you can create
  your Metriport account.
</Card>

<Tip>
  To demo the app without having to use your production enviroment simply head
  over to the settings page and toggle "sandbox". This will allow you to try out
  metriport with up to 10 connected users.
</Tip>

## 2. Generate an API key

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to get your API key:

- In the left hand menu, click "Settings".
- On the Settings page, click the "Create Subscription" button, and add your payment info.
- After that's done, back on the Settings page, you'll be able to click the "Generate API Key" button.

<Info>
  This API key will allow you to start making requests to the Metriport API on
  your behalf. Keep it somewhere safe!
</Info>

<Tip>
  If you believe your key has been compromised, you can always revoke it and
  then generate a new one on the Settings page by clicking the trash button
  beside the key.
</Tip>

## 3. Setup the Metriport client on your server

In the root of your server project, run the following terminal command to install the Metriport client:

```bash
npm install --save @metriport/api
```

From here, all you need to do is to initialize a Metriport client instance using your API
key, and you're good to start making requests to the Metriport API from your server:

```typescript
import { Metriport } from "@metriport/api";

const metriportClient = new Metriport("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

## 4. Link to the Metriport Connect widget in your app

With Metriport, you get a pre-built [Connect widget](https://connect.metriport.com/?token=demo)
that you can easily plug into your app, so that your users can connect all of their data sources to your application!
Here's a preview:

<iframe width="90%" height="700" src="https://connect.metriport.com/?token=demo"> </iframe>


To hook this up, on your server you'll just need to create each user in Metriport, and
generate a temporary token for each Connect session:

```typescript
// create user in Metriport and get the Metriport user ID
const metriportUserId = await metriportClient.getMetriportUserId(
  "your-internal-user-id"
);

// create a session token to be used in the Metriport Connect widget
const connectToken = await metriportClient.getConnectToken(metriportUserId);
```

<Info>
  As the Metriport user ID is reused for all subsequent data requests, we
  recommend saving it in your database for future requests.
</Info>

Then, in your application's front end, simply link to the Metriport Connect widget
and pass in that session token you generated above:

```typescript
window.open(`https://connect.metriport.com/?token=${connectToken}`);
```

<Info>
  The token will expire 10 minutes after it is created, and can be reused for
  the duration of the Connect session.
</Info>

<Info>
  To start the widget in sandbox mode, you can add the `sandbox=true` query param:
  
  ```typescript
  window.open(`https://connect.metriport.com/?token=${connectToken}&sandbox=true`);
  ```
</Info>

## 5. Access your user's health data ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

<Check>
  That's it, now you're ready to start accessing all of your user's health data
  from all of the data sources they've connected to your app!
