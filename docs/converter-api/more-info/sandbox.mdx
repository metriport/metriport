# Overview

Metriport offers a Sandbox environment so you can develop your medical applications more easily.

You can toggle Sandbox mode using the switch in the navbar on the Dashboard anytime.

<Warning>
  In Sandbox mode, you are limited to a small number of daily queries, and limited performance.
  If you need to use the Convert API for production workloads, request production access to get rolling as quickly as possible. 
</Warning>
