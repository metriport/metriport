<Tip>
  The more demographic information you can provide about a Patient, the higher chances Metriport
  will be able to find a match. For example: nicknames, old addresses, multiple phone numbers, a
  pre-marital last name, etc.

<ParamField body="hieOptOut" type="boolean">
  Indicates if the Patient has opted out of Health Information Exchanges (HIE).
</ParamField>

<Info>
  If the optional `hieOptOut` param is set to `true`, the Patient will not be included in any HIE
  exchanges. This means that the Patient's information will not be shared with other healthcare
