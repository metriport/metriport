<Tip>
  The more demographic information you can provide about a Patient, the higher chances Metriport will be
  able to find a match. For example: nicknames, old addresses, multiple phone numbers, a pre-marital
  last name, etc.

<ParamField body="externalId" type="string">
  An external Patient ID to associate to a Patient in Metriport.
</ParamField>

<Info>
  If the optional `externalId` param is provided, you can expect to see it returned in the responses
  involving the Patient. It will also be included within the webhook payloads. If the Metriport patient gets mapped
  to a patient in a third party EHR, Metriport will automatically map that into the patient and webhooks payloads.
