## Overview

When using the Devices API, Metriport will send Webhook messages containing [user data](#user-data-message) to your app
from [our supported Providers](/devices-api/more-info/our-integrations), as soon as the data becomes available.

To enable this integration approach with Metriport, and for some prerequesite reading to understand
how the Webhook flow works, see [our Webhooks guide](/home/api-info/webhooks).

<Info>
  Each provider may have unique use cases so be sure to check the [notes
  section](/devices-api/more-info/our-integrations#notes) of our [Our Integrations
  page](/devices-api/more-info/our-integrations).

    - `messageId`: this request ID from Metriport, useful for debugging purposes only;
    - `when`: the timestamp when this message was originally sent, formatted as [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
      (example: `2022-12-24T00:46:05.413Z`)
    - `users`: array of users, where each item represents all of that user's information available
      in this request (more data might be available in subsequent requests)
    - for each user:
      - `userId`: the user ID as defined by your application when it called [`/create-user`](/user/create-user)
      - `data`: array of data points for the given user; this follows the same format of the response
        of the SDK API reference
        - in the example above, `user-id-1` has 2 entries of [`sleep`](/health-device-api-reference/get-sleep-data)
          data and 1 entry of [`activity`](/health-device-api-reference/get-activity-data) data
