<Info>
  Before getting started, visit the [Apple Health docs](/more-info/apple-health#initial-setup) and
  follow the Initial Setup section to configure HealthKit."
</Info>

## Installation

```sh
npm install @metriport/react-native-sdk
npm install react-native-webview
```

You'll need to ensure that the MetriportSDK pod is installed as well.

```sh
cd ios
pod install
```

## Usage

To use our SDK go to the root of your project and add:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { MetriportWidget } from "@metriport/react-native-sdk";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MetriportWidget
      token="CONNECT_TOKEN"
      clientApiKey="CLIENT_API_KEY"
      sandbox={false}
      style={styles.box}
    />
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
  },
});
```

<Warning>
  Ensure you use your Client Key here, and not your Secret Key. You can read more about the
  differences between the two in our [API Keys guide](/home/api-info/api-keys).
</Warning>

<Info>
  As per the guide, we recommend to store your Client Key in environment secrets, and not commit it
  in plain text to your repository.
</Info>

<Info>
  As per the Quickstart guide, you'll need to generate a token on your server before opening the
  Connect Widget. You can read more about this
  [here](/getting-started/connect-quickstart#4-link-to-the-metriport-connect-widget-in-your-app).
