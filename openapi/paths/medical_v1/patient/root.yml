    Creates a Patient in Metriport for the specified Facility where the patient
    is receiving care.

    The more demographic info you can provide about a Patient,

    the higher chances Metriport will be able to find a match.

    For example, nicknames, old addresses, multiple phone numbers,

    a pre-marital last name, etc.
