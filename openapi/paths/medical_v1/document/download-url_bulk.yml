    Triggers a process to generate a list of download URLs for all of the
    patient's documents.

    The status of the process is returned in the response. Initially, it will be
    `processing`,

    and when the process is finished, the status will be updated to `completed`
    or `failed`.

    If you trigger this endpoint again while the process is still running, you
    will get a response

    that reflects the current progress.
