title: fhirTiming
type: object
description: >-
  Specifies an event that may occur multiple times. Timing schedules are used to
  record when things are planned, expected or requested to occur. The most
  common usage is in dosage instructions for medications. They are also used
  when planning care of various kinds, and may be used for reporting the
  schedule to which past regular activities were carried out.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  event:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Identifies specific times when the event occurs.
  repeat:
    $ref: ./fhirTimingRepeat.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A set of rules that describe when the event is scheduled.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A code for the timing schedule (or just text in code.text). Some codes
      such as BID are ubiquitous, but many institutions define their own
      additional codes. If a code is provided, the code is understood to be a
      complete statement of whatever is specified in the structured timing data,
      and either the code or the data may be used to interpret the Timing, with
      the exception that .repeat.bounds still applies over the code (and is not
      contained in the code).
