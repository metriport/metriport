title: fhirConceptMapDependsOn
type: object
description: >-
  A statement of relationships from one set of concepts to one or more other
  concepts - either concepts in code systems, or data element/data element
  concepts, or classes in class models.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  property:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A reference to an element that holds a coded value that corresponds to a
      code system property. The idea is that the information model carries an
      element somewhere that is labeled to correspond with a code system
      property.
  system:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that identifies the code system of the dependency code (if
      the source/dependency is a value set that crosses code systems).
  value:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identity (code or path) or the element/item/ValueSet/text that the map
      depends on / refers to.
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors
      when editing the concept map.
