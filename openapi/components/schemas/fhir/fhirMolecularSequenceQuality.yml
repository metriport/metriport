properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirMolecularSequenceQualityType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: INDEL / SNP / Undefined variant.
  standardSequence:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Gold standard sequence used for comparing against.
  start:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Start position of the sequence. If the coordinate system is either 0-based
      or 1-based, then start position is inclusive.
  end:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      End position of the sequence. If the coordinate system is 0-based then end
      is exclusive and does not include the last position. If the coordinate
      system is 1-base, then end is inclusive and includes the last position.
  score:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The score of an experimentally derived feature such as a p-value
      ([SO:0001685](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001685)).
  method:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Which method is used to get sequence quality.
  truthTP:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      True positives, from the perspective of the truth data, i.e. the number of
      sites in the Truth Call Set for which there are paths through the Query
      Call Set that are consistent with all of the alleles at this site, and for
      which there is an accurate genotype call for the event.
  queryTP:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      True positives, from the perspective of the query data, i.e. the number of
      sites in the Query Call Set for which there are paths through the Truth
      Call Set that are consistent with all of the alleles at this site, and for
      which there is an accurate genotype call for the event.
  truthFN:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      False negatives, i.e. the number of sites in the Truth Call Set for which
      there is no path through the Query Call Set that is consistent with all of
      the alleles at this site, or sites for which there is an inaccurate
      genotype call for the event. Sites with correct variant but incorrect
      genotype are counted here.
  queryFP:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      False positives, i.e. the number of sites in the Query Call Set for which
      there is no path through the Truth Call Set that is consistent with this
      site. Sites with correct variant but incorrect genotype are counted here.
  gtFP:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The number of false positives where the non-REF alleles in the Truth and
      Query Call Sets match (i.e. cases where the truth is 1/1 and the query is
      0/1 or similar).
  precision:

    description: QUERY.TP / (QUERY.TP + QUERY.FP).
  recall:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: TRUTH.TP / (TRUTH.TP + TRUTH.FN).
  fScore:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Harmonic mean of Recall and Precision, computed as: 2 _ precision _ recall
      / (precision + recall).
  roc:
    $ref: ./fhirMolecularSequenceRoc.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve to give
      sensitivity/specificity tradeoff.
