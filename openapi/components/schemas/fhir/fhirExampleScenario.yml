      - ExampleScenario
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this example scenario when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      example scenario is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of
      a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the example scenario
      is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this example scenario when it
      is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the example
      scenario when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the example scenario
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the example scenario. This name should
      be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirExampleScenarioStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this example scenario. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
      the content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this example scenario is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the example scenario was published.
      The date must change when the business version changes and it must change
      if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the example scenario changes. (e.g. the 'content
      logical definition').
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the example
      scenario.

      $ref: ./fhirContactDetail.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
      publisher.

    type: array

      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate example scenario instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A legal or geographic region in which the example scenario is intended to
      be used.
  copyright:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A copyright statement relating to the example scenario and/or its
      contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use
      and publishing of the example scenario.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      What the example scenario resource is created for. This should not be used
      to show the business purpose of the scenario itself, but the purpose of
      documenting a scenario.
