title: fhirPlanDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a
  sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough
  to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as
  clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - PlanDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this plan definition when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this plan
      definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the plan definition is
      stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this plan definition when it
      is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the plan
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the plan definition author
      and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
      timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is
      also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support
      Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0).
      For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision
      Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for
      non-experimental active artifacts.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
