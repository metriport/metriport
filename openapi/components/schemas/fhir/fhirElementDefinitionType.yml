title: fhirElementDefinitionType
type: object
description: >-
  Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or
  extension.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      URL of Data type or Resource that is a(or the) type used for this element.
      References are URLs that are relative to
      http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition e.g. "string" is a reference to
      http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/string. Absolute URLs are only
      allowed in logical models.
  profile:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies a profile structure or implementation Guide that applies to the
      datatype this element refers to. If any profiles are specified, then the
      content must conform to at least one of them. The URL can be a local
      reference - to a contained StructureDefinition, or a reference to another
      StructureDefinition or Implementation Guide by a canonical URL. When an
      implementation guide is specified, the type SHALL conform to at least one
      profile defined in the implementation guide.
  targetProfile:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Used when the type is "Reference" or "canonical", and identifies a profile
      structure or implementation Guide that applies to the target of the
      reference this element refers to. If any profiles are specified, then the
      content must conform to at least one of them. The URL can be a local
      reference - to a contained StructureDefinition, or a reference to another
      StructureDefinition or Implementation Guide by a canonical URL. When an
      implementation guide is specified, the target resource SHALL conform to at
      least one profile defined in the implementation guide.
  aggregation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirElementDefinitionTypeAggregationItem.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If the type is a reference to another resource, how the resource is or can
      be aggregated - is it a contained resource, or a reference, and if the
      context is a bundle, is it included in the bundle.
  versioning:
    $ref: ./fhirElementDefinitionTypeVersioning.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether this reference needs to be version specific or version
      independent, or whether either can be used.
