title: fhirDataRequirementCodeFilter
type: object
description: >-
  Describes a required data item for evaluation in terms of the type of data,
  and optional code or date-based filters of the data.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  path:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path SHALL be a
      FHIRPath resolveable on the specified type of the DataRequirement, and
      SHALL consist only of identifiers, constant indexers, and .resolve(). The
      path is allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as
      well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements (see
      the [Simple FHIRPath Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details).
      Note that the index must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to
      an element of type code, Coding, or CodeableConcept.
  searchParam:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A token parameter that refers to a search parameter defined on the
      specified type of the DataRequirement, and which searches on elements of
      type code, Coding, or CodeableConcept.
  valueSet:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and code elements are
      additive. If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data
      items for which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path
      is a member of the specified valueset.
  code:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The codes for the code filter. If values are given, the filter will return
      only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the
      path has a value that is one of the specified codes. If codes are
      specified in addition to a value set, the filter returns items matching a
      code in the value set or one of the specified codes.
