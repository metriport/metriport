type: object
description: >-
  A guidance response is the formal response to a guidance request, including
  any output parameters returned by the evaluation, as well as the description
  of any proposed actions to be taken.

  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - GuidanceResponse
  requestIdentifier:
    $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier of the request associated with this response. If an
      identifier was given as part of the request, it will be reproduced here to
      enable the requester to more easily identify the response in a
      multi-request scenario.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Allows a service to provide unique, business identifiers for the response.
  moduleUri:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An identifier, CodeableConcept or canonical reference to the guidance that
      was requested.
  moduleCanonical:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An identifier, CodeableConcept or canonical reference to the guidance that
      was requested.
  moduleCodeableConcept:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An identifier, CodeableConcept or canonical reference to the guidance that
      was requested.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirGuidanceResponseStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of the response. If the evaluation is completed successfully,
      the status will indicate success. However, in order to complete the
      evaluation, the engine may require more information. In this case, the
      status will be data-required, and the response will contain a description
      of the additional required information. If the evaluation completed
      successfully, but the engine determines that a potentially more accurate
      response could be provided if more data was available, the status will be
      data-requested, and the response will contain a description of the
      additional requested information.
  subject:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The patient for which the request was processed.
  encounter:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The encounter during which this response was created or to which the
      creation of this record is tightly associated.
  occurrenceDateTime:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Indicates when the guidance response was processed.
  performer:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Provides a reference to the device that performed the guidance.
  reasonCode:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Describes the reason for the guidance response in coded or textual form.
  reasonReference:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the reason the request was initiated. This is typically provided
      as a parameter to the evaluation and echoed by the service, although for
      some use cases, such as subscription- or event-based scenarios, it may
      provide an indication of the cause for the response.
  note:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirAnnotation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Provides a mechanism to communicate additional information about the
      response.
  evaluationMessage:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Messages resulting from the evaluation of the artifact or artifacts. As
      part of evaluating the request, the engine may produce informational or
      warning messages. These messages will be provided by this element.
  outputParameters:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The output parameters of the evaluation, if any. Many modules will result
      in the return of specific resources such as procedure or communication
      requests that are returned as part of the operation result. However,
      modules may define specific outputs that would be returned as the result
      of the evaluation, and these would be returned in this element.
  result:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The actions, if any, produced by the evaluation of the artifact.
  dataRequirement:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirDataRequirement.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If the evaluation could not be completed due to lack of information, or
      additional information would potentially result in a more accurate
      response, this element will a description of the data required in order to
      proceed with the evaluation. A subsequent request to the service should
      include this data.
