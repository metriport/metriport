    description: A code that classifies the general type of observation being made.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    description: >-
      Describes what was observed. Sometimes this is called the observation
      "name".
  subject:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The patient, or group of patients, location, or device this observation is
      about and into whose record the observation is placed. If the actual focus
      of the observation is different from the subject (or a sample of, part, or
      region of the subject), the `focus` element or the `code` itself specifies
      the actual focus of the observation.
  focus:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The actual focus of an observation when it is not the patient of record
      representing something or someone associated with the patient such as a
      spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. For example, fetus observations in a
      mother's record. The focus of an observation could also be an existing
      condition, an intervention, the subject's diet, another observation of the
      subject, or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device. An example
      use case would be using the Observation resource to capture whether the
      mother is trained to change her child's tracheostomy tube. In this
      example, the child is the patient of record and the mother is the focus.
  encounter:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The healthcare event (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction)
      during which this observation is made.
  effectiveDateTime:

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The time or time-period the observed value is asserted as being true. For
      biological subjects - e.g. human patients - this is usually called the
      "physiologically relevant time". This is usually either the time of the
      procedure or of specimen collection, but very often the source of the
      date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.

    description: >-
      This observation is a group observation (e.g. a battery, a panel of tests,

  component:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirObservationComponent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Some observations have multiple component observations. These component

      same attributes. Examples include systolic and diastolic component
      observations for blood pressure measurement and multiple component
      observations for genetics observations.
