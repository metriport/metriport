type: object
description: >-
  A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR
  Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
  actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
  implementation.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  type:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A type of resource exposed via the restful interface.
  profile:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A specification of the profile that describes the solution's overall
      support for the resource, including any constraints on cardinality,
      bindings, lengths or other limitations. See further discussion in [Using
      Profiles](profiling.html#profile-uses).
  supportedProfile:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the
      system. For a server, "supported by the system" means the system
      hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular
      profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this
      profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system
      will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance
      implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using
      Profiles](profiling.html#profile-uses).
  documentation:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Additional information about the resource type used by the system.
  interaction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementInteraction.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Identifies a restful operation supported by the solution.
  versioning:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementResourceVersioning.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      This field is set to no-version to specify that the system does not
      support (server) or use (client) versioning for this resource type. If
      this has some other value, the server must at least correctly track and
      populate the versionId meta-property on resources. If the value is
      'versioned-update', then the server supports all the versioning features,
      including using e-tags for version integrity in the API.
  readHistory:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A flag for whether the server is able to return past versions as part of
      the vRead operation.
  updateCreate:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A flag to indicate that the server allows or needs to allow the client to
      create new identities on the server (that is, the client PUTs to a
      location where there is no existing resource). Allowing this operation
      means that the server allows the client to create new identities on the
      server.
  conditionalCreate:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: A flag that indicates that the server supports conditional create.
  conditionalRead:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementResourceConditionalRead.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A code that indicates how the server supports conditional read.
  conditionalUpdate:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: A flag that indicates that the server supports conditional update.
  conditionalDelete:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementResourceConditionalDelete.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A code that indicates how the server supports conditional delete.
  referencePolicy:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementResourceReferencePolicyItem.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A set of flags that defines how references are supported.
  searchInclude:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A list of \_include values supported by the server.
  searchRevInclude:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A list of \_revinclude (reverse include) values supported by the server.
  searchParam:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementSearchParam.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Search parameters for implementations to support and/or make use of -
      either references to ones defined in the specification, or additional ones
      defined for/by the implementation.
  operation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementOperation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Definition of an operation or a named query together with its parameters
      and their meaning and type. Consult the definition of the operation for
      details about how to invoke the operation, and the parameters.
