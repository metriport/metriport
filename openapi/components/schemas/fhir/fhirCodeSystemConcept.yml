title: fhirCodeSystemConcept
type: object
description: >-
  The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of and describe a
  code system or code system supplement and its key properties, and optionally
  define a part or all of its content.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A code - a text symbol - that uniquely identifies the concept within the
      code system.
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A human readable string that is the recommended default way to present
      this concept to a user.
  definition:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The formal definition of the concept. The code system resource does not
      make formal definitions required, because of the prevalence of legacy
      systems. However, they are highly recommended, as without them there is no
      formal meaning associated with the concept.
  designation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeSystemDesignation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Additional representations for the concept - other languages, aliases,
      specialized purposes, used for particular purposes, etc.
  property:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeSystemProperty1.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A property value for this concept.
  concept:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeSystemConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Defines children of a concept to produce a hierarchy of concepts. The
      nature of the relationships is variable (is-a/contains/categorizes) - see
      hierarchyMeaning.
