title: fhirTerminologyCapabilities
type: object
description: >-
  A TerminologyCapabilities resource documents a set of capabilities (behaviors)
  of a FHIR Terminology Server that may be used as a statement of actual server
  functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - TerminologyCapabilities
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this terminology capabilities
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance;
      also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and
      SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of
      this terminology capabilities is (or will be) published. This URL can be
      the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the
      terminology capabilities is stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the terminology
      capabilities when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the terminology
      capabilities author and is not expected to be globally unique. For
      example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is
      not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in
      a lexicographical sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the terminology capabilities. This
      name should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine
      processing applications such as code generation.

      A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the terminology
      capabilities.

    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this terminology capabilities is authored
      for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not
      intended to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the terminology capabilities was
      published. The date must change when the business version changes and it
      must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when
      the substantive content of the terminology capabilities changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the terminology
      capabilities.

    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A free text natural language description of the terminology capabilities
      from a consumer's perspective. Typically, this is used when the capability
      statement describes a desired rather than an actual solution, for example
      as a formal expression of requirements as part of an RFP.
  useContext:

      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate terminology capabilities instances.

    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true

    description: >-
      The way that this statement is intended to be used, to describe an actual

  software:
    $ref: ./fhirTerminologyCapabilitiesSoftware.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Software that is covered by this terminology capability statement. It is
      used when the statement describes the capabilities of a particular
      software version, independent of an installation.
  implementation:
    $ref: ./fhirTerminologyCapabilitiesImplementation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies a specific implementation instance that is described by the
      terminology capability statement - i.e. a particular installation, rather
      than the capabilities of a software program.

  codeSystem:
    type: array
    items:
