description: The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:

    description: >-
      Indicates a meaning for the supplemental data. This can be as simple as a
      unique identifier, or it can establish meaning in a broader context by
      drawing from a terminology, allowing supplemental data to be correlated
      across measures.
  usage:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An indicator of the intended usage for the supplemental data element.
      Supplemental data indicates the data is additional information requested
      to augment the measure information. Risk adjustment factor indicates the
      data is additional information used to calculate risk adjustment factors
      when applying a risk model to the measure calculation.
  description:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The human readable description of this supplemental data.
  criteria:
    $ref: ./fhirExpression.yml
    description: >-
      The criteria for the supplemental data. This is typically the name of a
      valid expression defined within a referenced library, but it may also be a
      path to a specific data element. The criteria defines the data to be
      returned for this element.
