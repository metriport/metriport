title: fhirImplementationGuide
type: object
description: >-
  A set of rules of how a particular interoperability or standards problem is
  solved - typically through the use of FHIR resources. This resource is used to
  gather all the parts of an implementation guide into a logical whole and to
  publish a computable definition of all the parts.

  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ImplementationGuide
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this implementation guide when it
      is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      implementation guide is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target
      of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the implementation
      guide is stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the implementation
      guide when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
      This is an arbitrary value managed by the implementation guide author and
      is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
      timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is
      also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the implementation guide. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the implementation guide.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirImplementationGuideStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this implementation guide. Enables tracking the life-cycle
      of the content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this implementation guide is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the implementation guide was
      published. The date must change when the business version changes and it
      must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when
      the substantive content of the implementation guide changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the
      implementation guide.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate implementation guide instances.

      to be used.
  copyright:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A copyright statement relating to the implementation guide and/or its
      contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use
      and publishing of the implementation guide.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The NPM package name for this Implementation Guide, used in the NPM
      package distribution, which is the primary mechanism by which FHIR based
      tooling manages IG dependencies. This value must be globally unique, and
      should be assigned with care.

      targets - e.g. describes how to use. The value of this element is the
      formal version of the specification, without the revision number, e.g.
      [publication].[major].[minor], which is 4.0.1. for this version.
