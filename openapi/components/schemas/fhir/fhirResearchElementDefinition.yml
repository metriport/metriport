type: object
description: >-
  The ResearchElementDefinition resource describes a "PICO" element that
  knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ResearchElementDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this research element definition
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance;
      also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and
      SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of
      this research element definition is (or will be) published. This URL can
      be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the
      research element definition is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this research element
      definition when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a
      specification, model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the research
      element definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design
      or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the research element
      definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example,
      it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not
      available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a
      lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the
      Decision Support Service specification, use the format
      Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning
      knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification.
      Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
