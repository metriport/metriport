title: fhirOperationDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  A formal computable definition of an operation (on the RESTful interface) or a
  named query (using the search interaction).
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - OperationDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this operation definition when it
      is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      operation definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target
      of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the operation
      definition is stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the operation
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the operation definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the operation definition. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the operation definition.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirOperationDefinitionStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this operation definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle
      of the content.

    nullable: true
    description: Whether this is an operation or a named query.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this operation definition is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the operation definition was
      published. The date must change when the business version changes and it
      must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when
      the substantive content of the operation definition changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the operation
      definition.

      a consumer's perspective.
  useContext:
    type: array

      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate operation definition instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A legal or geographic region in which the operation definition is intended
      to be used.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Explanation of why this operation definition is needed and why it has been
      designed as it has.
  affectsState:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether the operation affects state. Side effects such as producing audit
      trail entries do not count as 'affecting state'.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates whether this operation or named query can be invoked at the
      system level (e.g. without needing to choose a resource type for the
      context).
  type:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates whether this operation or named query can be invoked at the
      resource type level for any given resource type level (e.g. without
      needing to choose a specific resource id for the context).
  instance:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true

      of one of the given types.
