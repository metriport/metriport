title: fhirCompositionEvent
type: object
description: >-
  A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
  single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
  establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
  who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
  content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
  constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
  Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
  Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
  Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a
      colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event
      is inherent in the typeCode, such as a "History and Physical Report" in
      which the procedure being documented is necessarily a "History and
      Physical" act.
  period:
    $ref: ./fhirPeriod.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The period of time covered by the documentation. There is no assertion
      that the documentation is a complete representation for this period, only
      that it documents events during this time.
  detail:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The description and/or reference of the event(s) being documented. For
      example, this could be used to document such a colonoscopy or an
      appendectomy.
