      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
