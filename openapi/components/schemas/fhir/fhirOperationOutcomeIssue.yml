      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.

      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  severity:

      Indicates whether the issue indicates a variation from successful
      processing.

      Describes the type of the issue. The system that creates an
      OperationOutcome SHALL choose the most applicable code from the IssueType

      This element is deprecated because it is XML specific. It is replaced by
      issue.expression, which is format independent, and simpler to parse. For
      resource issues, this will be a simple XPath limited to element names,
      repetition indicators and the default child accessor that identifies one
      of the elements in the resource that caused this issue to be raised. For
      HTTP errors, will be "http." + the parameter name.

      A [simple subset of FHIRPath](fhirpath.html#simple) limited to element
      names, repetition indicators and the default child accessor that
      identifies one of the elements in the resource that caused this issue to
      be raised.
