title: fhirMessageDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  Defines the characteristics of a message that can be shared between systems,
  including the type of event that initiates the message, the content to be
  transmitted and what response(s), if any, are permitted.
properties:

    type: string
    enum:
      - MessageDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The business identifier that is used to reference the MessageDefinition
      and _is_ expected to be consistent from server to server.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this message definition when
      it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification,
      model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the message
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the message definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the message definition. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
