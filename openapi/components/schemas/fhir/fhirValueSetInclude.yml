type: object
description: >-
  A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
  code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
  between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
  elements](terminologies.html).
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  system:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI which is the code system from which the selected codes
      come from.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The version of the code system that the codes are selected from, or the
      special version '\*' for all versions.
  concept:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirValueSetConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Specifies a concept to be included or excluded.
  filter:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirValueSetFilter.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Select concepts by specify a matching criterion based on the properties
      (including relationships) defined by the system, or on filters defined by
      the system. If multiple filters are specified, they SHALL all be true.
  valueSet:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Selects the concepts found in this value set (based on its value set
      definition). This is an absolute URI that is a reference to ValueSet.url.
      If multiple value sets are specified this includes the union of the
      contents of all of the referenced value sets.
