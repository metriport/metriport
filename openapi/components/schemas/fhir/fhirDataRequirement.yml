title: fhirDataRequirement
type: object
description: >-
  Describes a required data item for evaluation in terms of the type of data,
  and optional code or date-based filters of the data.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  type:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The type of the required data, specified as the type name of a resource.
      For profiles, this value is set to the type of the base resource of the
      profile.
  profile:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The profile of the required data, specified as the uri of the profile
      definition.
  subjectCodeableConcept:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The intended subjects of the data requirement. If this element is not
      provided, a Patient subject is assumed.
  subjectReference:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The intended subjects of the data requirement. If this element is not
      provided, a Patient subject is assumed.
  mustSupport:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates that specific elements of the type are referenced by the
      knowledge module and must be supported by the consumer in order to obtain
      an effective evaluation. This does not mean that a value is required for
      this element, only that the consuming system must understand the element
      and be able to provide values for it if they are available. The value of
      mustSupport SHALL be a FHIRPath resolveable on the type of the
      DataRequirement. The path SHALL consist only of identifiers, constant
      indexers, and .resolve() (see the [Simple FHIRPath
      Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details).
  codeFilter:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirDataRequirementCodeFilter.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Code filters specify additional constraints on the data, specifying the
      value set of interest for a particular element of the data. Each code
      filter defines an additional constraint on the data, i.e. code filters are
      AND'ed, not OR'ed.
  dateFilter:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirDataRequirementDateFilter.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Date filters specify additional constraints on the data in terms of the
      applicable date range for specific elements. Each date filter specifies an
      additional constraint on the data, i.e. date filters are AND'ed, not
      OR'ed.
  limit:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Specifies a maximum number of results that are required (uses the \_count
      search parameter).
  sort:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirDataRequirementSort.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Specifies the order of the results to be returned.
