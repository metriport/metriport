description: >-
  The Evidence resource describes the conditional state (population and any
  exposures being compared within the population) and outcome (if specified)
  that the knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - Evidence
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this evidence when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      evidence is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the evidence is stored
      on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this evidence when it is
      represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the evidence when
      it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
      arbitrary value managed by the evidence author and is not expected to be
      globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
      managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that
      versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version
      consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format
      Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning
      knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification.
      Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-

      descriptive contexts where the full, formal title is not necessary.
