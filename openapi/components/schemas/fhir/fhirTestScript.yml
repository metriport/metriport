  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this test script when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this test
      script is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the test script is
      stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this test script when it is
      represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the test script
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This
      is an arbitrary value managed by the test script author and is not
      expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
      yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no
      expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the test script. This name should be
      usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
      such as code generation.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the test script was published. The
      date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
      the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the test script changes.
