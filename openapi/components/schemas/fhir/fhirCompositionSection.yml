title: fhirCompositionSection
type: object
description: >-
  A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
  single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
  establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
  who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
  content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
  constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
  Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
  Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
  Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The label for this particular section. This will be part of the rendered
      content for the document, and is often used to build a table of contents.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A code identifying the kind of content contained within the section. This
      must be consistent with the section title.
  author:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies who is responsible for the information in this section, not
      necessarily who typed it in.
  focus:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The actual focus of the section when it is not the subject of the
      composition, but instead represents something or someone associated with
      the subject such as (for a patient subject) a spouse, parent, fetus, or
      donor. If not focus is specified, the focus is assumed to be focus of the
      parent section, or, for a section in the Composition itself, the subject
      of the composition. Sections with a focus SHALL only include resources
      where the logical subject (patient, subject, focus, etc.) matches the
      section focus, or the resources have no logical subject (few resources).
  text:
    $ref: ./fhirNarrative.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A human-readable narrative that contains the attested content of the
      section, used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The
      narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to
      contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just
      read the narrative.
  mode:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      How the entry list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is
      suitable for being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a
      snapshot of a list of items from another source, or whether it is a
      prepared list where items may be marked as added, modified or deleted.
  orderedBy:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Specifies the order applied to the items in the section entries.
  entry:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A reference to the actual resource from which the narrative in the section
      is derived.
  emptyReason:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If the section is empty, why the list is empty. An empty section typically
      has some text explaining the empty reason.
  section:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCompositionSection.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A nested sub-section within this section.
