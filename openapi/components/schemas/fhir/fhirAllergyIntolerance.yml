    description: >-
      Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential
      risk, of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical
      product).
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirAllergyIntoleranceType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction
      risk.
  category:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirAllergyIntoleranceCategoryItem.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Category of the identified substance.
  criticality:
    $ref: ./fhirAllergyIntoleranceCriticality.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction
      to the identified substance.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a
      negated/excluded statement). This may be a code for a substance or
      pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the
      adverse reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition
      (e.g., "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific
      substance or class (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical
      negated statement (e.g., "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").
      Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the
      substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent
      with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand
      medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance.
      It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the
      'reaction.substance'. If a receiving system is unable to confirm that
      AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of
      AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore
      AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
