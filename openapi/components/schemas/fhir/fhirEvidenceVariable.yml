type: object
description: >-
  The EvidenceVariable resource describes a "PICO" element that knowledge
  (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - EvidenceVariable
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this evidence variable when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      evidence variable is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of
      a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the evidence variable
      is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this evidence variable when
      it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification,
      model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the evidence
      variable when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the evidence variable
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support
      Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0).
      For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision
      Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for
      non-experimental active artifacts.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the evidence variable. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  title:

    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the evidence variable.

      The short title provides an alternate title for use in informal
      descriptive contexts where the full, formal title is not necessary.

      An explanatory or alternate title for the EvidenceVariable giving
      additional information about its content.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the evidence variable was published.
      The date must change when the business version changes and it must change
      if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the evidence variable changes.
