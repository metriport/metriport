  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - CompartmentDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this compartment definition when
      it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      compartment definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the
      target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the
      compartment definition is stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the compartment
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the compartment definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the compartment definition. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirCompartmentDefinitionStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this compartment definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle

    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this compartment definition is authored
      for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not
      intended to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the compartment definition was
      published. The date must change when the business version changes and it
      must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when
      the substantive content of the compartment definition changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the compartment
      definition.

      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate compartment definition instances.
