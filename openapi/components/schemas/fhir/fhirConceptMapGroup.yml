title: fhirConceptMapGroup
type: object
description: >-
  A statement of relationships from one set of concepts to one or more other
  concepts - either concepts in code systems, or data element/data element
  concepts, or classes in class models.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  source:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that identifies the source system where the concepts to be
      mapped are defined.
  sourceVersion:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The specific version of the code system, as determined by the code system
      authority.
  target:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that identifies the target system that the concepts will
      be mapped to.
  targetVersion:
    type: string
    nullable: true

      The specific version of the code system, as determined by the code system
      authority.
  element:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirConceptMapElement.yml
    description: >-
      Mappings for an individual concept in the source to one or more concepts
      in the target.
  unmapped:
    $ref: ./fhirConceptMapUnmapped.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      What to do when there is no mapping for the source concept. "Unmapped"
      does not include codes that are unmatched, and the unmapped element is
      ignored in a code is specified to have equivalence = unmatched.
