title: fhirValueSetConcept
type: object
description: >-
  A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
  code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
  between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
  elements](terminologies.html).
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Specifies a code for the concept to be included or excluded.
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The text to display to the user for this concept in the context of this
      valueset. If no display is provided, then applications using the value set
      use the display specified for the code by the system.
  designation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirValueSetDesignation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Additional representations for this concept when used in this value set -
      other languages, aliases, specialized purposes, used for particular
      purposes, etc.
