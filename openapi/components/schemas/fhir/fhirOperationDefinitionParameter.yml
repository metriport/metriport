type: object
description: >-
  A formal computable definition of an operation (on the RESTful interface) or a
  named query (using the search interaction).
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:

      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  name:

    description: Whether this is an input or an output parameter.
  min:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The minimum number of times this parameter SHALL appear in the request or
      response.

    description: >-
      Used when the type is "Reference" or "canonical", and identifies a profile
      structure or implementation Guide that applies to the target of the
      reference this parameter refers to. If any profiles are specified, then
      the content must conform to at least one of them. The URL can be a local
      reference - to a contained StructureDefinition, or a reference to another
      StructureDefinition or Implementation Guide by a canonical URL. When an
      implementation guide is specified, the target resource SHALL conform to at
      least one profile defined in the implementation guide.
  searchType:
    $ref: ./fhirOperationDefinitionParameterSearchType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      How the parameter is understood as a search parameter. This is only used
      if the parameter type is 'string'.
  binding:

    description: >-
      Binds to a value set if this parameter is coded (code, Coding,
