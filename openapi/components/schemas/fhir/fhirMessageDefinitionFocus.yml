type: object
description: >-
  Defines the characteristics of a message that can be shared between systems,
  including the type of event that initiates the message, the content to be
  transmitted and what response(s), if any, are permitted.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The kind of resource that must be the focus for this message.
  profile:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A profile that reflects constraints for the focal resource (and
      potentially for related resources).
  min:
    $ref: ./fhirunsignedInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies the minimum number of resources of this type that must be
      pointed to by a message in order for it to be valid against this
      MessageDefinition.
  max:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies the maximum number of resources of this type that must be
      pointed to by a message in order for it to be valid against this
      MessageDefinition.
