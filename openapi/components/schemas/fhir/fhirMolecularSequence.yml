    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A sequence that is used as a reference to describe variants that are
      present in a sequence analyzed.
  variant:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirMolecularSequenceVariant.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The definition of variant here originates from Sequence ontology
      ([variant_of](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/variant_of)).
      This element can represent amino acid or nucleic sequence change(including
      insertion,deletion,SNP,etc.) It can represent some complex mutation or
      segment variation with the assist of CIGAR string.
  observedSeq:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Sequence that was observed. It is the result marked by referenceSeq along
      with variant records on referenceSeq. This shall start from
      referenceSeq.windowStart and end by referenceSeq.windowEnd.
  quality:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirMolecularSequenceQuality.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An experimental feature attribute that defines the quality of the feature
      in a quantitative way, such as a phred quality score
      ([SO:0001686](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001686)).
  readCoverage:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing
