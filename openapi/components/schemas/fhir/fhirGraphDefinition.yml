title: fhirGraphDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  A formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent
  set of resources that form a graph by following references. The Graph
  Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - GraphDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this graph definition when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this graph
      definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the graph definition is
      stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the graph
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the graph definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the graph definition. This name should
      be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirGraphDefinitionStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this graph definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
      the content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this graph definition is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the graph definition was published.
      The date must change when the business version changes and it must change
      if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the graph definition changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the graph
      definition.
  contact:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirContactDetail.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
      publisher.
  description:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A free text natural language description of the graph definition from a
      consumer's perspective.
  useContext:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate graph definition instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A legal or geographic region in which the graph definition is intended to
      be used.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Explanation of why this graph definition is needed and why it has been
      designed as it has.
