title: fhirConceptMapUnmapped
type: object
description: >-
  A statement of relationships from one set of concepts to one or more other
  concepts - either concepts in code systems, or data element/data element
  concepts, or classes in class models.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  mode:
    $ref: ./fhirConceptMapUnmappedMode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Defines which action to take if there is no match for the source concept
      in the target system designated for the group. One of 3 actions are
      possible: use the unmapped code (this is useful when doing a mapping
      between versions, and only a few codes have changed), use a fixed code (a
      default code), or alternatively, a reference to a different concept map
      can be provided (by canonical URL).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The fixed code to use when the mode = 'fixed' - all unmapped codes are
      mapped to a single fixed code.
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors
      when editing the concept map.
  url:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The canonical reference to an additional ConceptMap resource instance to
      use for mapping if this ConceptMap resource contains no matching mapping
      for the source concept.
