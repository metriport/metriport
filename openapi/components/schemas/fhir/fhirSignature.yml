title: fhirSignature
type: object
description: >-
  A signature along with supporting context. The signature may be a digital
  signature that is cryptographic in nature, or some other signature acceptable
  to the domain. This other signature may be as simple as a graphical image
  representing a hand-written signature, or a signature ceremony Different
  signature approaches have different utilities.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  type:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    description: >-
      An indication of the reason that the entity signed this document. This may
      be explicitly included as part of the signature information and can be
      used when determining accountability for various actions concerning the
      document.
  when:
    $ref: ./fhirinstant.yml
    nullable: true
    description: When the digital signature was signed.
  who:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    description: >-
      A reference to an application-usable description of the identity that
      signed (e.g. the signature used their private key).
  onBehalfOf:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A reference to an application-usable description of the identity that is
      represented by the signature.
  targetFormat:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A mime type that indicates the technical format of the target resources
      signed by the signature.
  sigFormat:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A mime type that indicates the technical format of the signature.
      Important mime types are application/signature+xml for X ML DigSig,
      application/jose for JWS, and image/\* for a graphical image of a
      signature, etc.
  data:
    $ref: ./fhirbase64Binary.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The base64 encoding of the Signature content. When signature is not
      recorded electronically this element would be empty.
