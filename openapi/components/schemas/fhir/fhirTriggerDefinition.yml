title: fhirTriggerDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  A description of a triggering event. Triggering events can be named events,
  data events, or periodic, as determined by the type element.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirTriggerDefinitionType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The type of triggering event.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal name for the event. This may be an absolute URI that identifies
      the event formally (e.g. from a trigger registry), or a simple relative
      URI that identifies the event in a local context.
  timingTiming:
    $ref: ./fhirTiming.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The timing of the event (if this is a periodic trigger).
  timingReference:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The timing of the event (if this is a periodic trigger).
  timingDate:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The timing of the event (if this is a periodic trigger).
  timingDateTime:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The timing of the event (if this is a periodic trigger).
  data:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirDataRequirement.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The triggering data of the event (if this is a data trigger). If more than
      one data is requirement is specified, then all the data requirements must
      be true.
  condition:
    $ref: ./fhirExpression.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A boolean-valued expression that is evaluated in the context of the
      container of the trigger definition and returns whether or not the trigger
      fires.
