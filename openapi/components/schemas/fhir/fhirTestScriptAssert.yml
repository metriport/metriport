description: >-
  A structured set of tests against a FHIR server or client implementation to
  determine compliance against the FHIR specification.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  label:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The label would be used for tracking/logging purposes by test engines.

    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The description would be used by test engines for tracking and reporting
      purposes.

  compareToSourceExpression:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The FHIRPath expression to evaluate against the source fixture. When
      compareToSourceId is defined, either compareToSourceExpression or
      compareToSourcePath must be defined, but not both.
  compareToSourcePath:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      XPath or JSONPath expression to evaluate against the source fixture. When
      compareToSourceId is defined, either compareToSourceExpression or
      compareToSourcePath must be defined, but not both.
  contentType:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The mime-type contents to compare against the request or response message
      'Content-Type' header.
  expression:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The FHIRPath expression to be evaluated against the request or response
      message contents - HTTP headers and payload.
  headerField:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The HTTP header field name e.g. 'Location'.
  minimumId:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The ID of a fixture. Asserts that the response contains at a minimum the
      fixture specified by minimumId.
  navigationLinks:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether or not the test execution performs validation on the bundle
      navigation links.
  operator:
    $ref: ./fhirTestScriptAssertOperator.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The operator type defines the conditional behavior of the assert. If not
      defined, the default is equals.
  path:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The XPath or JSONPath expression to be evaluated against the fixture
      representing the response received from server.
  requestMethod:
    $ref: ./fhirTestScriptAssertRequestMethod.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The request method or HTTP operation code to compare against that used by
      the client system under test.
  requestURL:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The value to use in a comparison against the request URL path string.
  resource:

      against.
  validateProfileId:
    $ref: ./fhirid.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The ID of the Profile to validate against.
  value:
    type: string
    nullable: true
