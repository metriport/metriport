title: fhirMeasureReportStratum
type: object
description: >-
  The MeasureReport resource contains the results of the calculation of a
  measure; and optionally a reference to the resources involved in that
  calculation.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  value:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The value for this stratum, expressed as a CodeableConcept. When defining
      stratifiers on complex values, the value must be rendered such that the
      value for each stratum within the stratifier is unique.
  component:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirMeasureReportComponent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A stratifier component value.
  population:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirMeasureReportPopulation1.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The populations that make up the stratum, one for each type of population
      appropriate to the measure.
  measureScore:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The measure score for this stratum, calculated as appropriate for the
      measure type and scoring method, and based on only the members of this
      stratum.
