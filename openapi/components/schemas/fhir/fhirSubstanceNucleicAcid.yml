title: fhirSubstanceNucleicAcid
type: object
description: >-
  Nucleic acids are defined by three distinct elements: the base, sugar and
  linkage. Individual substance/moiety IDs will be created for each of these
  elements. The nucleotide sequence will be always entered in the 5’-3’
  direction.

  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - SubstanceNucleicAcid
  sequenceType:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The type of the sequence shall be specified based on a controlled
      vocabulary.
  numberOfSubunits:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The number of linear sequences of nucleotides linked through
      phosphodiester bonds shall be described. Subunits would be strands of
      nucleic acids that are tightly associated typically through Watson-Crick
      base pairing. NOTE: If not specified in the reference source, the
      assumption is that there is 1 subunit.
  areaOfHybridisation:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The area of hybridisation shall be described if applicable for double
      stranded RNA or DNA. The number associated with the subunit followed by
      the number associated to the residue shall be specified in increasing
      order. The underscore “” shall be used as separator as follows:
      “Subunitnumber Residue”.

    type: array

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Subunits are listed in order of decreasing length; sequences of the same
      length will be ordered by molecular weight; subunits that have identical
      sequences will be repeated multiple times.
