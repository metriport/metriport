type: object
description: >-
  Source material shall capture information on the taxonomic and anatomical
  origins as well as the fraction of a material that can result in or can be
  modified to form a substance. This set of data elements shall be used to
  define polymer substances isolated from biological matrices. Taxonomic and
  anatomical origins shall be described using a controlled vocabulary as
  required. This information is captured for naturally derived polymers ( .
  starch) and structurally diverse substances. For Organisms belonging to the
  Kingdom Plantae the Substance level defines the fresh material of a single
  species or infraspecies, the Herbal Drug and the Herbal preparation. For
  Herbal preparations, the fraction information will be captured at the
  Substance information level and additional information for herbal extracts
  will be captured at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. See for
  further explanation the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal
  annex.

    type: string

    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:

    nullable: true

      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:

    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
