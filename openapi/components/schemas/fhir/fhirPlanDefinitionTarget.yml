title: fhirPlanDefinitionTarget
type: object
description: >-
  This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a
  sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough
  to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as
  clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  measure:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The parameter whose value is to be tracked, e.g. body weight, blood
      pressure, or hemoglobin A1c level.
  detailQuantity:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The target value of the measure to be achieved to signify fulfillment of
      the goal, e.g. 150 pounds or 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values
      of the range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates
      that the goal is achieved at any value at or below the high value.
      Similarly, if the high value is missing, it indicates that the goal is
      achieved at any value at or above the low value.
  detailRange:
    $ref: ./fhirRange.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The target value of the measure to be achieved to signify fulfillment of
      the goal, e.g. 150 pounds or 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values
      of the range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates
      that the goal is achieved at any value at or below the high value.
      Similarly, if the high value is missing, it indicates that the goal is
      achieved at any value at or above the low value.
  detailCodeableConcept:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The target value of the measure to be achieved to signify fulfillment of
      the goal, e.g. 150 pounds or 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values
      of the range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates
      that the goal is achieved at any value at or below the high value.
      Similarly, if the high value is missing, it indicates that the goal is
      achieved at any value at or above the low value.
  due:
    $ref: ./fhirDuration.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the timeframe after the start of the goal in which the goal
      should be met.
