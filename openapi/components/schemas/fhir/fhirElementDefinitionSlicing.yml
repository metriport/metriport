type: object
description: >-
  Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or
  extension.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  discriminator:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirElementDefinitionDiscriminator.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Designates which child elements are used to discriminate between the
      slices when processing an instance. If one or more discriminators are
      provided, the value of the child elements in the instance data SHALL
      completely distinguish which slice the element in the resource matches
      based on the allowed values for those elements in each of the slices.
  description:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A human-readable text description of how the slicing works. If there is no
      discriminator, this is required to be present to provide whatever
      information is possible about how the slices can be differentiated.
  ordered:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If the matching elements have to occur in the same order as defined in the
      profile.
  rules:
    $ref: ./fhirElementDefinitionSlicingRules.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether additional slices are allowed or not. When the slices are ordered,
      profile authors can also say that additional slices are only allowed at
      the end.
