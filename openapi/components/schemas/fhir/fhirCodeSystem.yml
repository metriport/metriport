type: object
description: >-
  The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of and describe a
  code system or code system supplement and its key properties, and optionally
  define a part or all of its content.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - CodeSystem
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this code system when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this code
      system is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the code system is
      stored on different servers. This is used in
      [Coding](datatypes.html#Coding).system.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this code system when it is
      represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the code system
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This
      is an arbitrary value managed by the code system author and is not
      expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
      yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no
      expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
      This is used in [Coding](datatypes.html#Coding).version.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the code system. This name should be
      usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
      such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the code system.

      or revised.

    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this code system is authored for testing
      purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
      used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the code system was published. The
      date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
      the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the code system changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The name of the organization or individual that published the code system.

      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate code system instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true

      A legal or geographic region in which the code system is intended to be
      used.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Explanation of why this code system is needed and why it has been designed
      as it has.
  copyright:

      publishing of the code system.

    nullable: true
    description: The code system defines a compositional (post-coordination) grammar.
  versionNeeded:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      This flag is used to signify that the code system does not commit to
      concept permanence across versions. If true, a version must be specified
      when referencing this code system.
  content:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeSystemContent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The extent of the content of the code system (the concepts and codes it
      defines) are represented in this resource instance.
  supplements:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-

  count:
    $ref: ./fhirunsignedInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The total number of concepts defined by the code system. Where the code
      system has a compositional grammar, the basis of this count is defined by
      the system steward.
  filter:

    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeSystemFilter.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-

    description: >-
      Concepts that are in the code system. The concept definitions are
