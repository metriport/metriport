title: fhirConceptMap
type: object
description: >-
  A statement of relationships from one set of concepts to one or more other
  concepts - either concepts in code systems, or data element/data element
  concepts, or classes in class models.

  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ConceptMap
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this concept map when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      concept map is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the concept map is
      stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this concept map when it is
      represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the concept map
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This
      is an arbitrary value managed by the concept map author and is not
      expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
      yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no
      expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the concept map. This name should be
      usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
      such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the concept map.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirConceptMapStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this concept map. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
      content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this concept map is authored for testing
      purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
      used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the concept map was published. The
      date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
      the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the concept map changes.
  publisher:
    type: string

      Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
      publisher.

    description: >-
      A free text natural language description of the concept map from a
      consumer's perspective.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate concept map instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true

      used.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Explanation of why this concept map is needed and why it has been designed
      as it has.

    description: >-
      A copyright statement relating to the concept map and/or its contents.
      Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
      publishing of the concept map.
  sourceUri:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifier for the source value set that contains the concepts that are
      being mapped and provides context for the mappings.

      Identifier for the source value set that contains the concepts that are
      being mapped and provides context for the mappings.
  targetUri:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The target value set provides context for the mappings. Note that the
      mapping is made between concepts, not between value sets, but the value
      set provides important context about how the concept mapping choices are
      made.
  targetCanonical:
