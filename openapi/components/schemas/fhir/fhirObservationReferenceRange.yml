  Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other
  subject.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  low:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The value of the low bound of the reference range. The low bound of the
      reference range endpoint is inclusive of the value (e.g. reference range
      is >=5 - <=9). If the low bound is omitted, it is assumed to be
      meaningless (e.g. reference range is <=2.3).
  high:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The value of the high bound of the reference range. The high bound of the
      reference range endpoint is inclusive of the value (e.g. reference range
      is >=5 - <=9). If the high bound is omitted, it is assumed to be
      meaningless (e.g. reference range is >= 2.3).
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Codes to indicate the what part of the targeted reference population it
      applies to. For example, the normal or therapeutic range.
  appliesTo:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Codes to indicate the target population this reference range applies to.
      For example, a reference range may be based on the normal population or a
      particular sex or race. Multiple `appliesTo` are interpreted as an "AND"
      of the target populations. For example, to represent a target population
      of African American females, both a code of female and a code for African
      American would be used.
  age:
    $ref: ./fhirRange.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The age at which this reference range is applicable. This is a neonatal
      age (e.g. number of weeks at term) if the meaning says so.
  text:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Text based reference range in an observation which may be used when a
      quantitative range is not appropriate for an observation. An example would
      be a reference value of "Negative" or a list or table of "normals".
