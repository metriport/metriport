title: fhirConceptMapTarget
type: object
description: >-
  A statement of relationships from one set of concepts to one or more other
  concepts - either concepts in code systems, or data element/data element
  concepts, or classes in class models.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Identity (code or path) or the element/item that the map refers to.
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors
      when editing the concept map.
  equivalence:
    $ref: ./fhirConceptMapTargetEquivalence.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The equivalence between the source and target concepts (counting for the
      dependencies and products). The equivalence is read from target to source
      (e.g. the target is 'wider' than the source).
  comment:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A description of status/issues in mapping that conveys additional
      information not represented in the structured data.
  dependsOn:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirConceptMapDependsOn.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A set of additional dependencies for this mapping to hold. This mapping is
      only applicable if the specified element can be resolved, and it has the
      specified value.
  product:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirConceptMapDependsOn.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A set of additional outcomes from this mapping to other elements. To
      properly execute this mapping, the specified element must be mapped to
      some data element or source that is in context. The mapping may still be
      useful without a place for the additional data elements, but the
      equivalence cannot be relied on.
