title: fhirDeviceUdiCarrier
type: object
description: >-
  A type of a manufactured item that is used in the provision of healthcare
  without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a
  medical or non-medical device.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  deviceIdentifier:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The device identifier (DI) is a mandatory, fixed portion of a UDI that
      identifies the labeler and the specific version or model of a device.
  issuer:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Organization that is charged with issuing UDIs for devices. For example,
      the US FDA issuers include : 1) GS1:
      http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/gs1-di, 2) HIBCC:
      http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/hibcc-dI, 3) ICCBBA for blood containers:
      http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/iccbba-blood-di, 4) ICCBA for other
      devices: http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/iccbba-other-di.
  jurisdiction:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identity of the authoritative source for UDI generation within a
      jurisdiction. All UDIs are globally unique within a single namespace with
      the appropriate repository uri as the system. For example, UDIs of devices
      managed in the U.S. by the FDA, the value is
      http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/fda-udi.
  carrierAIDC:
    $ref: ./fhirbase64Binary.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The full UDI carrier of the Automatic Identification and Data Capture
      (AIDC) technology representation of the barcode string as printed on the
      packaging of the device - e.g., a barcode or RFID. Because of limitations
      on character sets in XML and the need to round-trip JSON data through XML,
      AIDC Formats _SHALL_ be base64 encoded.
  carrierHRF:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The full UDI carrier as the human readable form (HRF) representation of
      the barcode string as printed on the packaging of the device.
  entryType:
    $ref: ./fhirDeviceUdiCarrierEntryType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A coded entry to indicate how the data was entered.
