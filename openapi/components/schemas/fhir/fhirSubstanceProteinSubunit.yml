title: fhirSubstanceProteinSubunit
type: object
description: >-
  A SubstanceProtein is defined as a single unit of a linear amino acid
  sequence, or a combination of subunits that are either covalently linked or
  have a defined invariant stoichiometric relationship. This includes all
  synthetic, recombinant and purified SubstanceProteins of defined sequence,
  whether the use is therapeutic or prophylactic. This set of elements will be
  used to describe albumins, coagulation factors, cytokines, growth factors,
  peptide/SubstanceProtein hormones, enzymes, toxins, toxoids, recombinant
  vaccines, and immunomodulators.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  subunit:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Index of primary sequences of amino acids linked through peptide bonds in
      order of decreasing length. Sequences of the same length will be ordered
      by molecular weight. Subunits that have identical sequences will be
      repeated and have sequential subscripts.
  sequence:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids
      from N- to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes.
      Uppercase shall be used for L-amino acids and lowercase for D-amino acids.
      Transcribed SubstanceProteins will always be described using the
      translated sequence; for synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are
      not represented with a single letter code an X should be used within the
      sequence. The modified amino acids will be distinguished by their position
      in the sequence.
  length:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: Length of linear sequences of amino acids contained in the subunit.
  sequenceAttachment:
    $ref: ./fhirAttachment.yml
    nullable: true

      The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids
      from N- to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes.

  nTerminalModificationId:
    $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique identifier for molecular fragment modification based on the ISO
      11238 Substance ID.
  nTerminalModification:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the fragment modified at the N-terminal of the
      SubstanceProtein shall be specified.
  cTerminalModificationId:
    $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique identifier for molecular fragment modification based on the ISO
      11238 Substance ID.
  cTerminalModification:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The modification at the C-terminal shall be specified.
