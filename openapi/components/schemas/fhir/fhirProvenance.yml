title: fhirProvenance
type: object
description: >-
  Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
  involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource.
  Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling
  trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of
  contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
  provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of
  confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and
  stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally
  authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
