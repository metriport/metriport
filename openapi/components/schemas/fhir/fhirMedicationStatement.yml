title: fhirMedicationStatement
type: object
description: >-
  A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A
  MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication
  now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication
  in the future. The source of this information can be the patient, significant
  other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A common scenario
  where this information is captured is during the history taking process during
  a patient visit or stay. The medication information may come from sources such
  as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle, or from a list of
  medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. The primary
  difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is
  that the medication administration has complete administration information and
  is based on actual administration information from the person who administered
  the medication. A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.
  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact
  we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication,
  where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may
  be incomplete or missing or less precise. As stated earlier, the medication
  statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription
  bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party
  maintains. Medication administration is more formal and is not missing
  detailed information.
