title: fhirComposition
type: object
description: >-
  A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
  single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
  establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
  who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
  content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
  constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
  Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
  Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
  Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
