title: fhirDeviceMetric
type: object
description: >-
  Describes a measurement, calculation or setting capability of a medical
  device.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - DeviceMetric
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by the device or gateway
      software, manufacturers, other organizations or owners. For example:
      handle ID.
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    description: >-
      Describes the type of the metric. For example: Heart Rate, PEEP Setting,
      etc.
  unit:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Describes the unit that an observed value determined for this metric will
      have. For example: Percent, Seconds, etc.
  source:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Describes the link to the Device that this DeviceMetric belongs to and
      that contains administrative device information such as manufacturer,
      serial number, etc.
  parent:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Describes the link to the Device that this DeviceMetric belongs to and
      that provide information about the location of this DeviceMetric in the
      containment structure of the parent Device. An example would be a Device
      that represents a Channel. This reference can be used by a client
      application to distinguish DeviceMetrics that have the same type, but
      should be interpreted based on their containment location.
  operationalStatus:
    $ref: ./fhirDeviceMetricOperationalStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates current operational state of the device. For example: On, Off,
      Standby, etc.
  color:
    $ref: ./fhirDeviceMetricColor.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Describes the color representation for the metric. This is often used to
      aid clinicians to track and identify parameter types by color. In
      practice, consider a Patient Monitor that has ECG/HR and Pleth for
      example; the parameters are displayed in different characteristic colors,
      such as HR-blue, BP-green, and PR and SpO2- magenta.
  category:
    $ref: ./fhirDeviceMetricCategory.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the category of the observation generation process. A
      DeviceMetric can be for example a setting, measurement, or calculation.
  measurementPeriod:
    $ref: ./fhirTiming.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Describes the measurement repetition time. This is not necessarily the
      same as the update period. The measurement repetition time can range from
      milliseconds up to hours. An example for a measurement repetition time in
      the range of milliseconds is the sampling rate of an ECG. An example for a
      measurement repetition time in the range of hours is a NIBP that is
      triggered automatically every hour. The update period may be different
      than the measurement repetition time, if the device does not update the
      published observed value with the same frequency as it was measured.
  calibration:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirDeviceMetricCalibration.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Describes the calibrations that have been performed or that are required
      to be performed.
