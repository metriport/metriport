  context.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ActivityDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this activity definition when it
      is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      activity definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target
      of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the activity
      definition is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this activity definition when
      it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification,
      model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the activity
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the activity definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support
      Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0).
      For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision
      Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for
      non-experimental active assets.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
