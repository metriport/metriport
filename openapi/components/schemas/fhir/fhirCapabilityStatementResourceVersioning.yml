type: string
enum:
  - no-version
  - versioned
  - versioned-update
description: >-
  This field is set to no-version to specify that the system does not support
  (server) or use (client) versioning for this resource type. If this has some
  other value, the server must at least correctly track and populate the
  versionId meta-property on resources. If the value is 'versioned-update', then
  the server supports all the versioning features, including using e-tags for
  version integrity in the API.
