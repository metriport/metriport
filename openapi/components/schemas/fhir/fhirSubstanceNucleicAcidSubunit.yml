title: fhirSubstanceNucleicAcidSubunit
type: object
description: >-
  Nucleic acids are defined by three distinct elements: the base, sugar and
  linkage. Individual substance/moiety IDs will be created for each of these
  elements. The nucleotide sequence will be always entered in the 5’-3’
  direction.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  subunit:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Index of linear sequences of nucleic acids in order of decreasing length.
      Sequences of the same length will be ordered by molecular weight. Subunits
      that have identical sequences will be repeated and have sequential
      subscripts.
  sequence:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Actual nucleotide sequence notation from 5' to 3' end using standard
      single letter codes. In addition to the base sequence, sugar and type of
      phosphate or non-phosphate linkage should also be captured.
  length:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: The length of the sequence shall be captured.
  sequenceAttachment:
    $ref: ./fhirAttachment.yml
    nullable: true
    description: (TBC).
  fivePrime:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The nucleotide present at the 5’ terminal shall be specified based on a
      controlled vocabulary. Since the sequence is represented from the 5' to
      the 3' end, the 5’ prime nucleotide is the letter at the first position in
      the sequence. A separate representation would be redundant.
  threePrime:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The nucleotide present at the 3’ terminal shall be specified based on a
      controlled vocabulary. Since the sequence is represented from the 5' to
      the 3' end, the 5’ prime nucleotide is the letter at the last position in
      the sequence. A separate representation would be redundant.
  linkage:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirSubstanceNucleicAcidLinkage.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The linkages between sugar residues will also be captured.
  sugar:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirSubstanceNucleicAcidSugar.yml
    nullable: true
    description: 5.3.6.8.1 Sugar ID (Mandatory).
