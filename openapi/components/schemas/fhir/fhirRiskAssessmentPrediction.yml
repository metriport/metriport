title: fhirRiskAssessmentPrediction
type: object
description: >-
  An assessment of the likely outcome(s) for a patient or other subject as well
  as the likelihood of each outcome.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  outcome:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      One of the potential outcomes for the patient (e.g. remission, death, a
      particular condition).
  probabilityDecimal:
    type: number
    format: double
    nullable: true
    description: Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe).
  probabilityRange:
    $ref: ./fhirRange.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe).
  qualitativeRisk:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe),
      expressed as a qualitative value (e.g. low, medium, or high).
  relativeRisk:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the risk for this particular subject (with their specific
      characteristics) divided by the risk of the population in general.
      (Numbers greater than 1 = higher risk than the population, numbers less
      than 1 = lower risk.).
  whenPeriod:
    $ref: ./fhirPeriod.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the period of time or age range of the subject to which the
      specified probability applies.
  whenRange:
    $ref: ./fhirRange.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the period of time or age range of the subject to which the
      specified probability applies.
  rationale:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: Additional information explaining the basis for the prediction.
