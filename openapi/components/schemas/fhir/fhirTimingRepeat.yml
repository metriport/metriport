title: fhirTimingRepeat
type: object
description: >-
  Specifies an event that may occur multiple times. Timing schedules are used to
  record when things are planned, expected or requested to occur. The most
  common usage is in dosage instructions for medications. They are also used
  when planning care of various kinds, and may be used for reporting the
  schedule to which past regular activities were carried out.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  boundsDuration:
    $ref: ./fhirDuration.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of
      possible length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing
      schedule.
  boundsRange:
    $ref: ./fhirRange.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of
      possible length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing
      schedule.
  boundsPeriod:
    $ref: ./fhirPeriod.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of
      possible length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing
      schedule.
  count:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A total count of the desired number of repetitions across the duration of
      the entire timing specification. If countMax is present, this element
      indicates the lower bound of the allowed range of count values.
  countMax:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If present, indicates that the count is a range - so to perform the action
      between [count] and [countMax] times.
  duration:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      How long this thing happens for when it happens. If durationMax is
      present, this element indicates the lower bound of the allowed range of
      the duration.
  durationMax:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If present, indicates that the duration is a range - so to perform the
      action between [duration] and [durationMax] time length.
  durationUnit:
    $ref: ./fhirTimingRepeatDurationUnit.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The units of time for the duration, in UCUM units.
  frequency:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The number of times to repeat the action within the specified period. If
      frequencyMax is present, this element indicates the lower bound of the
      allowed range of the frequency.
  frequencyMax:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If present, indicates that the frequency is a range - so to repeat between
      [frequency] and [frequencyMax] times within the period or period range.
  period:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the duration of time over which repetitions are to occur; e.g.
      to express "3 times per day", 3 would be the frequency and "1 day" would
      be the period. If periodMax is present, this element indicates the lower
      bound of the allowed range of the period length.
  periodMax:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If present, indicates that the period is a range from [period] to
      [periodMax], allowing expressing concepts such as "do this once every 3-5
      days.
  periodUnit:
    $ref: ./fhirTimingRepeatPeriodUnit.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The units of time for the period in UCUM units.
  dayOfWeek:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If one or more days of week is provided, then the action happens only on
      the specified day(s).
  timeOfDay:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirtime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Specified time of day for action to take place.
  when:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirTimingRepeatWhenItem.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An approximate time period during the day, potentially linked to an event
      of daily living that indicates when the action should occur.
  offset:
    $ref: ./fhirunsignedInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The number of minutes from the event. If the event code does not indicate
      whether the minutes is before or after the event, then the offset is
      assumed to be after the event.
