  The status of the response. If the evaluation is completed successfully, the
  status will indicate success. However, in order to complete the evaluation,
  the engine may require more information. In this case, the status will be
  data-required, and the response will contain a description of the additional
  required information. If the evaluation completed successfully, but the engine
  determines that a potentially more accurate response could be provided if more
  data was available, the status will be data-requested, and the response will
  contain a description of the additional requested information.
