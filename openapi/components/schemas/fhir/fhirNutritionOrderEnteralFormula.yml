properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  baseFormulaType:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The type of enteral or infant formula such as an adult standard formula
      with fiber or a soy-based infant formula.
  baseFormulaProductName:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The product or brand name of the enteral or infant formula product such as
      "ACME Adult Standard Formula".
  additiveType:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates the type of modular component such as protein, carbohydrate, fat
      or fiber to be provided in addition to or mixed with the base formula.
  additiveProductName:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The product or brand name of the type of modular component to be added to
      the formula.
  caloricDensity:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The amount of energy (calories) that the formula should provide per
      specified volume, typically per mL or fluid oz. For example, an infant may
      require a formula that provides 24 calories per fluid ounce or an adult
      may require an enteral formula that provides 1.5 calorie/mL.
  routeofAdministration:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The route or physiological path of administration into the patient's
      gastrointestinal tract for purposes of providing the formula feeding, e.g.
      nasogastric tube.
  administration:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirNutritionOrderAdministration.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Formula administration instructions as structured data. This repeating
      structure allows for changing the administration rate or volume over time
      for both bolus and continuous feeding. An example of this would be an
      instruction to increase the rate of continuous feeding every 2 hours.
  maxVolumeToDeliver:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The maximum total quantity of formula that may be administered to a
      subject over the period of time, e.g. 1440 mL over 24 hours.
  administrationInstruction:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Free text formula administration, feeding instructions or additional
      instructions or information.
