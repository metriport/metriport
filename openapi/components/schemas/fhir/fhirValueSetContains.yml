type: object
description: >-
  A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
  code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
  between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
  elements](terminologies.html).
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  system:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI which is the code system in which the code for this item
      in the expansion is defined.
  abstract:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If true, this entry is included in the expansion for navigational
      purposes, and the user cannot select the code directly as a proper value.
  inactive:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      If the concept is inactive in the code system that defines it. Inactive
      codes are those that are no longer to be used, but are maintained by the
      code system for understanding legacy data. It might not be known or
      specified whether an concept is inactive (and it may depend on the context
      of use).
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The version of the code system from this code was taken. Note that a
      well-maintained code system does not need the version reported, because
      the meaning of codes is consistent across versions. However this cannot
      consistently be assured, and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be
      consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The code for this item in the expansion hierarchy. If this code is missing
      the entry in the hierarchy is a place holder (abstract) and does not
      represent a valid code in the value set.
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The recommended display for this item in the expansion.
  designation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirValueSetDesignation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Additional representations for this item - other languages, aliases,
      specialized purposes, used for particular purposes, etc. These are
      relevant when the conditions of the expansion do not fix to a single
      correct representation.
  contains:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirValueSetContains.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Other codes and entries contained under this entry in the hierarchy.
