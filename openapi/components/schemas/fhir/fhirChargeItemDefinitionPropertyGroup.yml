type: object
description: >-
  The ChargeItemDefinition resource provides the properties that apply to the
  (billing) codes necessary to calculate costs and prices. The properties may
  differ largely depending on type and realm, therefore this resource gives only
  a rough structure and requires profiling for each type of billing code system.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  applicability:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirChargeItemDefinitionApplicability.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Expressions that describe applicability criteria for the priceComponent.
  priceComponent:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirChargeItemDefinitionPriceComponent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The price for a ChargeItem may be calculated as a base price with
      surcharges/deductions that apply in certain conditions. A
      ChargeItemDefinition resource that defines the prices, factors and
      conditions that apply to a billing code is currently under development.
      The priceComponent element can be used to offer transparency to the
      recipient of the Invoice of how the prices have been calculated.
