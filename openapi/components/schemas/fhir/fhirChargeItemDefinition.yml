  The ChargeItemDefinition resource provides the properties that apply to the
  (billing) codes necessary to calculate costs and prices. The properties may
  differ largely depending on type and realm, therefore this resource gives only
  a rough structure and requires profiling for each type of billing code system.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ChargeItemDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this charge item definition when
      it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      charge item definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the
      target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the charge
      item definition is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this charge item definition
      when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification,
      model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the charge item
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the charge item definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support
      Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0).
      For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision
      Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for
      non-experimental active assets.
