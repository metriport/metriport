type: object
description: A reference to a code defined by a terminology system.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  system:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identification of the code system that defines the meaning of the
      symbol in the code.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The version of the code system which was used when choosing this code.
      Note that a well-maintained code system does not need the version
      reported, because the meaning of codes is consistent across versions.
      However this cannot consistently be assured, and when the meaning is not
      guaranteed to be consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A symbol in syntax defined by the system. The symbol may be a predefined
      code or an expression in a syntax defined by the coding system (e.g.
      post-coordination).
  display:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A representation of the meaning of the code in the system, following the
      rules of the system.
  userSelected:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Indicates that this coding was chosen by a user directly - e.g. off a pick
      list of available items (codes or displays).
