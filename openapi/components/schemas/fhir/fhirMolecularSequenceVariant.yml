properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  start:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Start position of the variant on the reference sequence. If the coordinate
      system is either 0-based or 1-based, then start position is inclusive.
  end:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      End position of the variant on the reference sequence. If the coordinate
      system is 0-based then end is exclusive and does not include the last
      position. If the coordinate system is 1-base, then end is inclusive and
      includes the last position.
  observedAllele:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An allele is one of a set of coexisting sequence variants of a gene
      ([SO:0001023](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001023)).
      Nucleotide(s)/amino acids from start position of sequence to stop position
      of sequence on the positive (+) strand of the observed sequence. When the
      sequence type is DNA, it should be the sequence on the positive (+)
      strand. This will lay in the range between variant.start and variant.end.
  referenceAllele:
    type: string
    nullable: true

  cigar:
    type: string

    description: >-
      Extended CIGAR string for aligning the sequence with reference bases. See
      detailed documentation
