      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.

      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the

      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
