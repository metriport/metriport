title: fhirSubstanceNucleicAcidLinkage
type: object
description: >-
  Nucleic acids are defined by three distinct elements: the base, sugar and
  linkage. Individual substance/moiety IDs will be created for each of these
  elements. The nucleotide sequence will be always entered in the 5’-3’
  direction.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  connectivity:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The entity that links the sugar residues together should also be captured
      for nearly all naturally occurring nucleic acid the linkage is a phosphate
      group. For many synthetic oligonucleotides phosphorothioate linkages are
      often seen. Linkage connectivity is assumed to be 3’-5’. If the linkage is
      either 3’-3’ or 5’-5’ this should be specified.
  identifier:
    $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Each linkage will be registered as a fragment and have an ID.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Each linkage will be registered as a fragment and have at least one name.
      A single name shall be assigned to each linkage.
  residueSite:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: Residues shall be captured as described in 5.3.6.8.3.
