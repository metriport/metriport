type: object
description: >-
  The metadata about a resource. This is content in the resource that is
  maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be
  associated with version changes to the resource.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-

      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  versionId:
    $ref: ./fhirid.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of
      the URL. This value changes when the resource is created, updated, or
      deleted.
  lastUpdated:
    $ref: ./fhirinstant.yml
    nullable: true
    description: When the resource last changed - e.g. when the version changed.
  source:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A uri that identifies the source system of the resource. This provides a
      minimal amount of [[[Provenance]]] information that can be used to track
      or differentiate the source of information in the resource. The source may
      identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc.
  profile:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A list of profiles (references to [[[StructureDefinition]]] resources)
      that this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to
      [[[StructureDefinition.url]]].
  security:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Security labels applied to this resource. These tags connect specific
      resources to the overall security policy and infrastructure.
  tag:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Tags applied to this resource. Tags are intended to be used to identify
      and relate resources to process and workflow, and applications are not
      required to consider the tags when interpreting the meaning of a resource.
  project:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The project that contains this resource.
  author:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The individual, device or organization who initiated the last change.
  account:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Optional account reference that can be used for sub-project compartments.

    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
