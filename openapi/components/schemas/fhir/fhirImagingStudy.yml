type: object
description: >-
  Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
  comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair
  Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a
  common context. A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR,
  ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.
