description: >-
  A SubstanceProtein is defined as a single unit of a linear amino acid
  sequence, or a combination of subunits that are either covalently linked or
  have a defined invariant stoichiometric relationship. This includes all
  synthetic, recombinant and purified SubstanceProteins of defined sequence,
  whether the use is therapeutic or prophylactic. This set of elements will be
  used to describe albumins, coagulation factors, cytokines, growth factors,
  peptide/SubstanceProtein hormones, enzymes, toxins, toxoids, recombinant
  vaccines, and immunomodulators.

      The SubstanceProtein descriptive elements will only be used when a
      complete or partial amino acid sequence is available or derivable from a
      nucleic acid sequence.

    description: >-
      Number of linear sequences of amino acids linked through peptide bonds.
      The number of subunits constituting the SubstanceProtein shall be
      described. It is possible that the number of subunits can be variable.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The disulphide bond between two cysteine residues either on the same
      subunit or on two different subunits shall be described. The position of
      the disulfide bonds in the SubstanceProtein shall be listed in increasing
      order of subunit number and position within subunit followed by the
      abbreviation of the amino acids involved. The disulfide linkage positions
      shall actually contain the amino acid Cysteine at the respective
      positions.

    description: >-
      This subclause refers to the description of each subunit constituting the
      SubstanceProtein. A subunit is a linear sequence of amino acids linked
      through peptide bonds. The Subunit information shall be provided when the
      finished SubstanceProtein is a complex of multiple sequences; subunits are
      not used to delineate domains within a single sequence. Subunits are
      listed in order of decreasing length; sequences of the same length will be
      ordered by decreasing molecular weight; subunits that have identical
      sequences will be repeated multiple times.
