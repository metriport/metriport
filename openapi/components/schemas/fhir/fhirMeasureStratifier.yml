properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:

    description: >-
      Indicates a meaning for the stratifier. This can be as simple as a unique
      identifier, or it can establish meaning in a broader context by drawing
      from a terminology, allowing stratifiers to be correlated across measures.
  description:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The human readable description of this stratifier criteria.
  criteria:
    $ref: ./fhirExpression.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An expression that specifies the criteria for the stratifier. This is
      typically the name of an expression defined within a referenced library,
      but it may also be a path to a stratifier element.
  component:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirMeasureComponent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A component of the stratifier criteria for the measure report, specified
      as either the name of a valid CQL expression defined within a referenced
      library or a valid FHIR Resource Path.
