type: object
description: >-
  Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
  comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair
  Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a
  common context. A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR,
  ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  uid:
    $ref: ./fhirid.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The DICOM Series Instance UID for the series.
  number:
    $ref: ./fhirunsignedInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The numeric identifier of this series in the study.
  modality:
    $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    description: The modality of this series sequence.
  description:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A description of the series.
  numberOfInstances:
    $ref: ./fhirunsignedInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Number of SOP Instances in the Study. The value given may be larger than
      the number of instance elements this resource contains due to resource
      availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present
      if any instance elements are present.
  endpoint:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The network service providing access (e.g., query, view, or retrieval) for
      this series. See implementation notes for information about using DICOM
      endpoints. A series-level endpoint, if present, has precedence over a
      study-level endpoint with the same Endpoint.connectionType.
  bodySite:
    $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The anatomic structures examined. See DICOM Part 16 Annex L
      (http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_L.html)
      for DICOM to SNOMED-CT mappings. The bodySite may indicate the laterality
      of body part imaged; if so, it shall be consistent with any content of
      ImagingStudy.series.laterality.
  laterality:
    $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The laterality of the (possibly paired) anatomic structures examined.
      E.g., the left knee, both lungs, or unpaired abdomen. If present, shall be
      consistent with any laterality information indicated in
      ImagingStudy.series.bodySite.
  specimen:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The specimen imaged, e.g., for whole slide imaging of a biopsy.
  started:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The date and time the series was started.
  performer:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirImagingStudyPerformer.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Indicates who or what performed the series and how they were involved.
  instance:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirImagingStudyInstance.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A single SOP instance within the series, e.g. an image, or presentation
      state.
required:
  - modality
