      - EventDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this event definition when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this event
      definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the event definition is
      stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this event definition when it
      is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the event
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the event definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
