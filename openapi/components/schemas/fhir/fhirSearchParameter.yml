title: fhirSearchParameter
type: object
description: >-
  A search parameter that defines a named search item that can be used to
  search/filter on a resource.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - SearchParameter
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this search parameter when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this search
      parameter is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the search parameter is
      stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the search
      parameter when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the search parameter
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the search parameter. This name should
      be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  derivedFrom:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Where this search parameter is originally defined. If a derivedFrom is
      provided, then the details in the search parameter must be consistent with
      the definition from which it is defined. i.e. the parameter should have
      the same meaning, and (usually) the functionality should be a proper
      subset of the underlying search parameter.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirSearchParameterStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this search parameter. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
      the content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this search parameter is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the search parameter was published.
      The date must change when the business version changes and it must change
      if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the search parameter changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the search
      parameter.
  contact:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirContactDetail.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
      publisher.

      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate search parameter instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A legal or geographic region in which the search parameter is intended to
      be used.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Explanation of why this search parameter is needed and why it has been
      designed as it has.
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The code used in the URL or the parameter name in a parameters resource
      for this search parameter.
  base:

  type:
    $ref: ./fhirSearchParameterType.yml

      is interpreted.

      parameter.
  xpath:

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An XPath expression that returns a set of elements for the search
      parameter.
  xpathUsage:

      How the search parameter relates to the set of elements returned by
      evaluating the xpath query.

  multipleOr:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether multiple values are allowed for each time the parameter exists.
      Values are separated by commas, and the parameter matches if any of the
      values match.
  multipleAnd:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether multiple parameters are allowed - e.g. more than one parameter
      with the same name. The search matches if all the parameters match.

      type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Contains the names of any search parameters which may be chained to the
      containing search parameter. Chained parameters may be added to search
      parameters of type reference and specify that resources will only be
      returned if they contain a reference to a resource which matches the
      chained parameter value. Values for this field should be drawn from
      SearchParameter.code for a parameter on the target resource type.
