title: fhirMedicationAdministrationDosage
type: object
description: >-
  Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a
  medication. This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long
  running infusion. Related resources tie this event to the authorizing
  prescription, and the specific encounter between patient and health care
  practitioner.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  text:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Free text dosage can be used for cases where the dosage administered is
      too complex to code. When coded dosage is present, the free text dosage
      may still be present for display to humans.


      The dosage instructions should reflect the dosage of the medication that
      was administered.
  site:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A coded specification of the anatomic site where the medication first
      entered the body. For example, "left arm".
  route:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A code specifying the route or physiological path of administration of a
      therapeutic agent into or onto the patient. For example, topical,
      intravenous, etc.
  method:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to
      be or was introduced into or on the body. This attribute will most often
      NOT be populated. It is most commonly used for injections. For example,
      Slow Push, Deep IV.
  dose:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The amount of the medication given at one administration event. Use this
      value when the administration is essentially an instantaneous event such
      as a swallowing a tablet or giving an injection.
  rateRatio:
    $ref: ./fhirRatio.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced
      into the patient. Typically, the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1
      hour or 100 ml/hr. May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time, e.g.
      500 ml per 2 hours. Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1
      liter/8 hours.
  rateQuantity:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
