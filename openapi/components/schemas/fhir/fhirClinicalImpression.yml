title: fhirClinicalImpression
type: object
description: >-
  A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may
  affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies
  that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with
  a clinical consultation / encounter, but this varies greatly depending on the
  clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
  "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
  such as Apgar score.
