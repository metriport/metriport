      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:

    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  sequence:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true

  chargeItemReference:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The ChargeItem contains information such as the billing code, date, amount
      etc. If no further details are required for the lineItem, inline billing
      codes can be added using the CodeableConcept data type instead of the
      Reference.
  chargeItemCodeableConcept:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true

  priceComponent:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirInvoicePriceComponent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The price for a ChargeItem may be calculated as a base price with
      surcharges/deductions that apply in certain conditions. A
      ChargeItemDefinition resource that defines the prices, factors and
      conditions that apply to a billing code is currently under development.
      The priceComponent element can be used to offer transparency to the
      recipient of the Invoice as to how the prices have been calculated.
