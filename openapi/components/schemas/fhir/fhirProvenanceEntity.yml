description: >-
  Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
  involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource.
  Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling
  trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of
  contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
  provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of
  confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and
  stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally
  authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  role:
    $ref: ./fhirProvenanceEntityRole.yml
    nullable: true
    description: How the entity was used during the activity.
  what:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    description: >-
      Identity of the Entity used. May be a logical or physical uri and maybe
      absolute or relative.
  agent:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirProvenanceAgent.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The entity is attributed to an agent to express the agent's responsibility
      for that entity, possibly along with other agents. This description can be
      understood as shorthand for saying that the agent was responsible for the
      activity which generated the entity.
