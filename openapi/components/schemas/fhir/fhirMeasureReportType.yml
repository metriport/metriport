  The type of measure report. This may be an individual report, which provides
  the score for the measure for an individual member of the population; a
  subject-listing, which returns the list of members that meet the various
  criteria in the measure; a summary report, which returns a population count
  for each of the criteria in the measure; or a data-collection, which enables
  the MeasureReport to be used to exchange the data-of-interest for a quality
  measure.
