type: object
description: >-
  Medplum project membership. A project membership grants a user access to a
  project.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ProjectMembership
  id:
    $ref: ./fhirid.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
      assigned, this value never changes.
  meta:
    $ref: ./fhirMeta.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
      infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
      version changes to the resource.
  implicitRules:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
      constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
      Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the
      special rules along with other profiles etc.
  language:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The base language in which the resource is written.
  project:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    description: Project where the memberships are available.
  invitedBy:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The project administrator who invited the user to the project.
  user:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    description: User that is granted access to the project.
  profile:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    description: >-
      Reference to the resource that represents the user profile within the

  externalId:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A String that is an identifier for the resource as defined by the
      provisioning client. The "externalId" may simplify identification of a
      resource between the provisioning client and the service provider by
      allowing the client to use a filter to locate the resource with an
      identifier from the provisioning domain, obviating the need to store a
      local mapping between the provisioning domain's identifier of the resource
      and the identifier used by the service provider. Each resource MAY include
      a non-empty "externalId" value. The value of the "externalId" attribute is
      always issued by the provisioning client and MUST NOT be specified by the
      service provider. The service provider MUST always interpret the
      externalId as scoped to the provisioning domain.
  accessPolicy:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
