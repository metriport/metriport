title: fhirStructureDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  A definition of a FHIR structure. This resource is used to describe the
  underlying resources, data types defined in FHIR, and also for describing
  extensions and constraints on resources and data types.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - StructureDefinition
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this structure definition when it
      is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      structure definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target
      of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the structure
      definition is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this structure definition
      when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification,
      model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the structure definition
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the structure definition. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string

    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this structure definition is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the structure definition was
      published. The date must change when the business version changes and it
      must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when
      the substantive content of the structure definition changes.

      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate structure definition instances.

    description: >-
      The version of the FHIR specification on which this StructureDefinition is
      based - this is the formal version of the specification, without the
      revision number, e.g. [publication].[major].[minor], which is 4.0.1. for
      this version.
  mapping:

  abstract:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Whether structure this definition describes is abstract or not - that is,
      whether the structure is not intended to be instantiated. For Resources
      and Data types, abstract types will never be exchanged between systems.
  context:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirStructureDefinitionContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies the types of resource or data type elements to which the
      extension can be applied.

    items:
      type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A set of rules as FHIRPath Invariants about when the extension can be used
      (e.g. co-occurrence variants for the extension). All the rules must be
      true.
  type:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The type this structure describes. If the derivation kind is
      'specialization' then this is the master definition for a type, and there
      is always one of these (a data type, an extension, a resource, including
      abstract ones). Otherwise the structure definition is a constraint on the
      stated type (and in this case, the type cannot be an abstract type).
      References are URLs that are relative to
      http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition e.g. "string" is a reference to
      http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/string. Absolute URLs are only
      allowed in logical models.
  baseDefinition:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is the base structure from which this type is
      derived, either by specialization or constraint.

    nullable: true
    description: How the type relates to the baseDefinition.

    description: >-
      A snapshot view is expressed in a standalone form that can be used and
      interpreted without considering the base StructureDefinition.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A differential view is expressed relative to the base StructureDefinition
      - a statement of differences that it applies.
