description: A container for a collection of resources.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  link:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirBundleLink.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A series of links that provide context to this entry.
  fullUrl:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The Absolute URL for the resource. The fullUrl SHALL NOT disagree with the
      id in the resource - i.e. if the fullUrl is not a urn:uuid, the URL shall
      be version-independent URL consistent with the Resource.id. The fullUrl is
      a version independent reference to the resource. The fullUrl element SHALL
      have a value except that: _ fullUrl can be empty on a POST (although it
      does not need to when specifying a temporary id for reference in the
      bundle) _ Results from operations might involve resources that are not
      identified.
  resource:
    description: >-
      The Resource for the entry. The purpose/meaning of the resource is
      determined by the Bundle.type.
  search:
    $ref: ./fhirBundleSearch.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-

  request:
    $ref: ./fhirBundleRequest.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Additional information about how this entry should be processed as part of
      a transaction or batch. For history, it shows how the entry was processed
      to create the version contained in the entry.
  response:

    nullable: true
    description: >-
