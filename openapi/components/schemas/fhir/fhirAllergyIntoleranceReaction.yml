title: fhirAllergyIntoleranceReaction
type: object
description: >-
  Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an
  individual and associated with exposure to a substance.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  substance:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identification of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product)
      considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event. Note: the
      substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance
      identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it.
      For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand
      medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance.
      It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the
      'reaction.substance'. If a receiving system is unable to confirm that
      AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of
      AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore
      AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
  manifestation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    description: >-
      Clinical symptoms and/or signs that are observed or associated with the
      adverse reaction event.
  description:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Text description about the reaction as a whole, including details of the
      manifestation if required.
  onset:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Record of the date and/or time of the onset of the Reaction.
  severity:
    $ref: ./fhirAllergyIntoleranceReactionSeverity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Clinical assessment of the severity of the reaction event as a whole,
      potentially considering multiple different manifestations.
  exposureRoute:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identification of the route by which the subject was exposed to the
      substance.
  note:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirAnnotation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Additional text about the adverse reaction event not captured in other
      fields.
