type: string
enum:

  - fixed
  - other-map
description: >-
  Defines which action to take if there is no match for the source concept in
  the target system designated for the group. One of 3 actions are possible: use
  the unmapped code (this is useful when doing a mapping between versions, and
  only a few codes have changed), use a fixed code (a default code), or
  alternatively, a reference to a different concept map can be provided (by
  canonical URL).
