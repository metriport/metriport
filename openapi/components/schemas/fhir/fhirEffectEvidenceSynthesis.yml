  between exposures states in a population where the effect estimate is derived
  from a combination of research studies.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - EffectEvidenceSynthesis
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this effect evidence synthesis
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance;
      also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and
      SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of
      this effect evidence synthesis is (or will be) published. This URL can be
      the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the
      effect evidence synthesis is stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this effect evidence
      synthesis when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a
      specification, model, design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the effect
      evidence synthesis when it is referenced in a specification, model, design
      or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the effect evidence
      synthesis author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example,
      it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not
      available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a
      lexicographical sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the effect evidence synthesis. This
      name should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine
      processing applications such as code generation.
