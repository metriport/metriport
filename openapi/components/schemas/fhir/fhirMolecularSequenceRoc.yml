properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  score:
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer

    description: >-
      Invidual data point representing the GQ (genotype quality) score
      threshold.
  numTP:
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-

      field value.
  numFP:
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The number of false positives if the GQ score threshold was set to "score"
      field value.
  numFN:
    type: array

      type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Calculated precision if the GQ score threshold was set to "score" field
      value.

    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Calculated sensitivity if the GQ score threshold was set to "score" field
      value.
