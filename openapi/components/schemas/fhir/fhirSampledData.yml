title: fhirSampledData
type: object
description: >-
  A series of measurements taken by a device, with upper and lower limits. There
  may be more than one dimension in the data.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  origin:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    description: >-
      The base quantity that a measured value of zero represents. In addition,
      this provides the units of the entire measurement series.
  period:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: The length of time between sampling times, measured in milliseconds.
  factor:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A correction factor that is applied to the sampled data points before they
      are added to the origin.
  lowerLimit:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The lower limit of detection of the measured points. This is needed if any
      of the data points have the value "L" (lower than detection limit).
  upperLimit:
    $ref: ./fhirdecimal.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The upper limit of detection of the measured points. This is needed if any
      of the data points have the value "U" (higher than detection limit).
  dimensions:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The number of sample points at each time point. If this value is greater
      than one, then the dimensions will be interlaced - all the sample points
      for a point in time will be recorded at once.
  data:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A series of data points which are decimal values separated by a single
      space (character u20). The special values "E" (error), "L" (below
      detection limit) and "U" (above detection limit) can also be used in place
      of a decimal value.
