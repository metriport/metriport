      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true

      evidence.detail), or a Procedure.
  priority:
    $ref: ./fhirunsignedInt.yml

  minutesDuration:
    $ref: ./fhirpositiveInt.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Number of minutes that the appointment is to take. This can be less than
      the duration between the start and end times. For example, where the
      actual time of appointment is only an estimate or if a 30 minute
      appointment is being requested, but any time would work. Also, if there
      is, for example, a planned 15 minute break in the middle of a long
      appointment, the duration may be 15 minutes less than the difference
      between the start and end.

      The date that this appointment was initially created. This could be
      different to the meta.lastModified value on the initial entry, as this
      could have been before the resource was created on the FHIR server, and
      should remain unchanged over the lifespan of the appointment.

      other situations the duration may be calculated by the scheduling system.
