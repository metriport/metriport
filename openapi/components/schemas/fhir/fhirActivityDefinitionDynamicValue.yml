title: fhirActivityDefinitionDynamicValue
type: object
description: >-
  This resource allows for the definition of some activity to be performed,
  independent of a particular patient, practitioner, or other performance
  context.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  path:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The path to the element to be customized. This is the path on the resource
      that will hold the result of the calculation defined by the expression.
      The specified path SHALL be a FHIRPath resolveable on the specified target
      type of the ActivityDefinition, and SHALL consist only of identifiers,
      constant indexers, and a restricted subset of functions. The path is
      allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as
      indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements (see the
      [Simple FHIRPath Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details).
  expression:
    $ref: ./fhirExpression.yml
