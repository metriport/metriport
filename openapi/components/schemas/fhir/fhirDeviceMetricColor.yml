  Describes the color representation for the metric. This is often used to aid
  clinicians to track and identify parameter types by color. In practice,
  consider a Patient Monitor that has ECG/HR and Pleth for example; the
  parameters are displayed in different characteristic colors, such as HR-blue,
  BP-green, and PR and SpO2- magenta.
