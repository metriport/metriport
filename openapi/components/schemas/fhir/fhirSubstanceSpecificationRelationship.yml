description: >-
  The detailed description of a substance, typically at a level beyond what is
  used for prescribing.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  substanceReference:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A pointer to another substance, as a resource or just a representational
      code.
  substanceCodeableConcept:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A pointer to another substance, as a resource or just a representational
      code.
  relationship:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: For example "salt to parent", "active moiety", "starting material".
  isDefining:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      For example where an enzyme strongly bonds with a particular substance,
      this is a defining relationship for that enzyme, out of several possible
      substance relationships.
  amountQuantity:
    $ref: ./fhirQuantity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the
      salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in
      relation to some other.
  amountRange:
    $ref: ./fhirRange.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the
      salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in
      relation to some other.
  amountRatio:
    $ref: ./fhirRatio.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the
      salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in
      relation to some other.
  amountString:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the
      salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in
      relation to some other.
  amountRatioLowLimit:
    $ref: ./fhirRatio.yml
    nullable: true
    description: For use when the numeric.
  amountType:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An operator for the amount, for example "average", "approximately", "less
      than".

    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
