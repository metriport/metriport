properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  chromosome:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Structural unit composed of a nucleic acid molecule which controls its own
      replication through the interaction of specific proteins at one or more
      origins of replication
      ([SO:0000340](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000340)).
  genomeBuild:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The Genome Build used for reference, following GRCh build versions e.g.
      'GRCh 37'. Version number must be included if a versioned release of a
      primary build was used.
  orientation:
    $ref: ./fhirMolecularSequenceReferenceSeqOrientation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A relative reference to a DNA strand based on gene orientation. The strand
      that contains the open reading frame of the gene is the "sense" strand,
      and the opposite complementary strand is the "antisense" strand.
  referenceSeqId:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Reference identifier of reference sequence submitted to NCBI. It must
      match the type in the MolecularSequence.type field. For example, the
      prefix, “NG*” identifies reference sequence for genes, “NM*” for messenger
      RNA transcripts, and “NP\_” for amino acid sequences.
  referenceSeqPointer:
    $ref: ./fhirReference.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A pointer to another MolecularSequence entity as reference sequence.
  referenceSeqString:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A string like "ACGT".
  strand:
    $ref: ./fhirMolecularSequenceReferenceSeqStrand.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute reference to a strand. The Watson strand is the strand whose
      5'-end is on the short arm of the chromosome, and the Crick strand as the
      one whose 5'-end is on the long arm.
  windowStart:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Start position of the window on the reference sequence. If the coordinate
      system is either 0-based or 1-based, then start position is inclusive.
  windowEnd:
    type: integer
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      End position of the window on the reference sequence. If the coordinate
      system is 0-based then end is exclusive and does not include the last
      position. If the coordinate system is 1-base, then end is inclusive and
      includes the last position.
