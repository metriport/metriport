  A Map of relationships between 2 structures that can be used to transform
  data.

  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - StructureMap
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this structure map when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
      its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
      literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      structure map is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
      canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the structure map is
      stored on different servers.
  identifier:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirIdentifier.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A formal identifier that is used to identify this structure map when it is
      represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
      design or an instance.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure map
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This
      is an arbitrary value managed by the structure map author and is not
      expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
      yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no
      expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the structure map. This name should be
      usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
      such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the structure map.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirStructureMapStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this structure map. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
      content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this structure map is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the structure map was published. The
      date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
      the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
      substantive content of the structure map changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the structure
      map.

      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate structure map instances.
