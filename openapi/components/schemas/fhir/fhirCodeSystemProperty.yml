title: fhirCodeSystemProperty
type: object
description: >-
  The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of and describe a
  code system or code system supplement and its key properties, and optionally
  define a part or all of its content.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  code:
    $ref: ./fhircode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A code that is used to identify the property. The code is used internally
      (in CodeSystem.concept.property.code) and also externally, such as in
      property filters.
  uri:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Reference to the formal meaning of the property. One possible source of
      meaning is the [Concept Properties](codesystem-concept-properties.html)
      code system.
  description:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A description of the property- why it is defined, and how its value might
      be used.
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirCodeSystemPropertyType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The type of the property value. Properties of type "code" contain a code
      defined by the code system (e.g. a reference to another defined concept).
