  identifier:
    type: array

    description: Identifier(s) by which this encounter is known.

  statusHistory:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirEncounterStatusHistory.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status history permits the encounter resource to contain the status
      history without needing to read through the historical versions of the
      resource, or even have the server store them.
  class:
    $ref: ./fhirCoding.yml
    description: >-
      Concepts representing classification of patient encounter such as
      ambulatory (outpatient), inpatient, emergency, home health or others due
      to local variations.
  classHistory:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirEncounterClassHistory.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The class history permits the tracking of the encounters transitions
      without needing to go through the resource history. This would be used for
      a case where an admission starts of as an emergency encounter, then
      transitions into an inpatient scenario. Doing this and not restarting a
      new encounter ensures that any lab/diagnostic results can more easily
      follow the patient and not require re-processing and not get lost or
      cancelled during a kind of discharge from emergency to inpatient.

      Where a specific encounter should be classified as a part of a specific
      episode(s) of care this field should be used. This association can
      facilitate grouping of related encounters together for a specific purpose,
      such as government reporting, issue tracking, association via a common
      problem. The association is recorded on the encounter as these are
      typically created after the episode of care and grouped on entry rather
      than editing the episode of care to append another encounter to it (the
      episode of care could span years).
