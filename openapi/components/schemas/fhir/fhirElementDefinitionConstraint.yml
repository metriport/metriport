type: object
description: >-
  Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or
  extension.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  key:
    $ref: ./fhirid.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Allows identification of which elements have their cardinalities impacted
      by the constraint. Will not be referenced for constraints that do not
      affect cardinality.
  requirements:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: Description of why this constraint is necessary or appropriate.
  severity:
    $ref: ./fhirElementDefinitionConstraintSeverity.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies the impact constraint violation has on the conformance of the
      instance.
  human:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Text that can be used to describe the constraint in messages identifying
      that the constraint has been violated.
  expression:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A [FHIRPath](fhirpath.html) expression of constraint that can be executed
      to see if this constraint is met.
  xpath:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An XPath expression of constraint that can be executed to see if this
      constraint is met.
  source:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A reference to the original source of the constraint, for traceability
      purposes.
