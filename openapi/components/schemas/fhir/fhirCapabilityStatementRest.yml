  A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR
  Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
  actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
  implementation.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  mode:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementRestMode.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies whether this portion of the statement is describing the ability
      to initiate or receive restful operations.
  documentation:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Information about the system's restful capabilities that apply across all
      applications, such as security.

    description: >-
      Information about security implementation from an interface perspective -

  resource:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementResource.yml

      resource type.

  searchParam:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementSearchParam.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Search parameters that are supported for searching all resources for
      implementations to support and/or make use of - either references to ones
      defined in the specification, or additional ones defined for/by the
      implementation.
  operation:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementOperation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Definition of an operation or a named query together with its parameters
      and their meaning and type.
  compartment:
    type: array

      that the system supports. The reference is to a CompartmentDefinition
      resource by its canonical URL .
