type: object
description: >-
  A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR
  Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
  actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
  implementation.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the operation or query. For an operation, this is the name
      prefixed with $ and used in the URL. For a query, this is the name used in
      the \_query parameter when the query is called.
  definition:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    description: >-
      Where the formal definition can be found. If a server references the base
      definition of an Operation (i.e. from the specification itself such as
      `http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/ValueSet-expand`), that means it
      supports the full capabilities of the operation - e.g. both GET and POST
      invocation. If it only supports a subset, it must define its own custom
      [[[OperationDefinition]]] with a 'base' of the original
      OperationDefinition. The custom definition would describe the specific
      subset of functionality supported.
  documentation:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Documentation that describes anything special about the operation
      behavior, possibly detailing different behavior for system, type and
      instance-level invocation of the operation.
