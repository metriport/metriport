  phraseology and grouping to allow coherent, consistent data collection.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  linkId:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-

  definition:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      This element is a URI that refers to an [[[ElementDefinition]]] that
      provides information about this item, including information that might

      detailed description of the construction of the URI is shown in Comments,
      below. If this element is present then the following element values MAY be
      derived from the Element Definition if the corresponding elements of this
      Questionnaire resource instance have no value: _ code
      (ElementDefinition.code) _ type (ElementDefinition.type) _ required
      (ElementDefinition.min) _ repeats (ElementDefinition.max) _ maxLength
      (ElementDefinition.maxLength) _ answerValueSet (ElementDefinition.binding)
      \* options (ElementDefinition.binding).
