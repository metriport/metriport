title: fhirImplementationGuideDefinition
type: object
description: >-
  A set of rules of how a particular interoperability or standards problem is
  solved - typically through the use of FHIR resources. This resource is used to
  gather all the parts of an implementation guide into a logical whole and to
  publish a computable definition of all the parts.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  grouping:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirImplementationGuideGrouping.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A logical group of resources. Logical groups can be used when building
      pages.
  resource:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirImplementationGuideResource.yml
    description: >-
      A resource that is part of the implementation guide. Conformance resources
      (value set, structure definition, capability statements etc.) are obvious
      candidates for inclusion, but any kind of resource can be included as an
      example resource.
  page:
    $ref: ./fhirImplementationGuidePage.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A page / section in the implementation guide. The root page is the
      implementation guide home page.
  parameter:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirImplementationGuideParameter.yml
    nullable: true
    description: Defines how IG is built by tools.
  template:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirImplementationGuideTemplate.yml
    nullable: true
    description: A template for building resources.
required:
  - resource
