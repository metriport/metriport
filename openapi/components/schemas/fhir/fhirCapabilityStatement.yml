type: object
description: >-
  A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR
  Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
  actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
  implementation.
properties:
  resourceType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - CapabilityStatement
  url:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is used to identify this capability statement when it
      is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also
      called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD
      be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
      capability statement is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target
      of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the capability
      statement is stored on different servers.
  version:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The identifier that is used to identify this version of the capability
      statement when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
      instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the capability statement
      author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be
      a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
      is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical
      sequence.
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A natural language name identifying the capability statement. This name
      should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
      applications such as code generation.
  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the capability statement.
  status:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementStatus.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The status of this capability statement. Enables tracking the life-cycle
      of the content.
  experimental:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A Boolean value to indicate that this capability statement is authored for
      testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended
      to be used for genuine usage.
  date:
    $ref: ./fhirdateTime.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The date (and optionally time) when the capability statement was
      published. The date must change when the business version changes and it
      must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when
      the substantive content of the capability statement changes.
  publisher:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The name of the organization or individual that published the capability
      statement.

      $ref: ./fhirContactDetail.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
      publisher.
  description:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A free text natural language description of the capability statement from
      a consumer's perspective. Typically, this is used when the capability
      statement describes a desired rather than an actual solution, for example
      as a formal expression of requirements as part of an RFP.
  useContext:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirUsageContext.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the
      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories
      (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance
      plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching
      for appropriate capability statement instances.
  jurisdiction:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirCodeableConcept.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A legal or geographic region in which the capability statement is intended
      to be used.
  purpose:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Explanation of why this capability statement is needed and why it has been
      designed as it has.
  copyright:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A copyright statement relating to the capability statement and/or its
      contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use
      and publishing of the capability statement.
  kind:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementKind.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The way that this statement is intended to be used, to describe an actual
      running instance of software, a particular product (kind, not instance of
      software) or a class of implementation (e.g. a desired purchase).
  instantiates:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Reference to a canonical URL of another CapabilityStatement that this
      software implements. This capability statement is a published API
      description that corresponds to a business service. The server may
      actually implement a subset of the capability statement it claims to
      implement, so the capability statement must specify the full capability
      details.
  imports:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Reference to a canonical URL of another CapabilityStatement that this
      software adds to. The capability statement automatically includes
      everything in the other statement, and it is not duplicated, though the
      server may repeat the same resources, interactions and operations to add
      additional details to them.
  software:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementSoftware.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Software that is covered by this capability statement. It is used when the
      capability statement describes the capabilities of a particular software
      version, independent of an installation.
  implementation:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementImplementation.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Identifies a specific implementation instance that is described by the
      capability statement - i.e. a particular installation, rather than the
      capabilities of a software program.
  fhirVersion:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementFhirVersion.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The version of the FHIR specification that this CapabilityStatement
      describes (which SHALL be the same as the FHIR version of the
      CapabilityStatement itself). There is no default value.
