      assigned, this value never changes.
  meta:
    $ref: ./fhirMeta.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
      infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
      version changes to the resource.
  implicitRules:
    $ref: ./fhiruri.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
      constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

      authorization code MUST expire shortly after it is issued to mitigate the
      risk of leaks. A maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
      RECOMMENDED. The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than
      once. If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization
      server MUST deny the request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens
      previously issued based on that authorization code. The authorization code
      is bound to the client identifier and redirection URI.
