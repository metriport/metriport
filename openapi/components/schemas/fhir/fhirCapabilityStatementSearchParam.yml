  A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR
  Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
  actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
  implementation.
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
      This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
  extension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension.
  modifierExtension:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ./fhirExtension.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the
      basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the
      element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the
      containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
      negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
      manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
      and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension,
      there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition
      of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check
      for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning
      of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the
      meaning of modifierExtension itself).
  name:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The name of the search parameter used in the interface.
  definition:
    $ref: ./fhircanonical.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      An absolute URI that is a formal reference to where this parameter was
      first defined, so that a client can be confident of the meaning of the
      search parameter (a reference to [[[SearchParameter.url]]]). This element
      SHALL be populated if the search parameter refers to a SearchParameter
      defined by the FHIR core specification or externally defined IGs.
  type:
    $ref: ./fhirCapabilityStatementSearchParamType.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The type of value a search parameter refers to, and how the content is
      interpreted.
  documentation:
    $ref: ./fhirmarkdown.yml
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      This allows documentation of any distinct behaviors about how the search
      parameter is used. For example, text matching algorithms.
