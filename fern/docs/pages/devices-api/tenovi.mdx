"Connect to Tenovi RPM devices.

## Overview

This is a guide to help you integrate with [Tenovi](https://tenovi.com/) - a remote patient monitoring (RPM) device provider.
When a patient takes measurements with Tenovi RPM devices, the data will be made available both through [webhooks](/home/api-info/webhooks),
and our [REST API](/devices-api/api-reference/get-biometrics-data).

<Callout intent="success">
  You can read more about what data types are supported on our [integrations
  page](/devices-api/more-info/our-integrations).
</Callout>

## Setup

<Callout intent="success">
  As a prerequisite, we recommend following our [Devices API quickstart
  guide](/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart), up to and including the "Integrate your
  app with Metriport" step.
</Callout>

To integrate with Tenovi, you will need to do the following for each of your users:

1. Obtain a [connect token](/devices-api/api-reference/user/create-connect-token) for the user;
1. Activate the user's Tenovi device(s) using the [Connect RPM Device](/devices-api/api-reference/connect/connect-rpm-device) endpoint.

<Callout intent="info">
  In the Connect RPM Device endpoint, you will need to use the Tenovi `Patient ID` as the
  `deviceUserId`, and the `HWI ID`, as `deviceIds`.
</Callout>

## REST Endpoints

<Callout intent="warn">To use any of these endpoints, you will **need** to use the [headers](#headers).</Callout>

With Tenovi, you can query for past user data using one of the following endpoints:

- [getBodyData](/devices-api/api-reference/get-body-data)
- [getBiometricsData](/devices-api/api-reference/get-biometrics-data)

You can revoke a user's access to Tenovi with the following endpoint:

- [revokeProviderAccess](/devices-api/api-reference/user/revoke-provider-access)

You can disconnect a single device from the user using the following endpoint:

- [disconnectDevice](/devices-api/api-reference/user/disconnect-device)

## Headers

The following headers are required to use the REST endpoints outlined above (see image below for reference).

`x-tenovi-api-key` `string` `required`
Your company's API key generated on Tenovi's Client Home page.

`x-tenovi-client-name` `string` `required`
Your company's name as indicated on your custom Tenovi URL, what comes after
"https://api2.tenovi.com/clients/...".

## Device Reassignment

If you would like to reassign a device from one patient to another, please follow these steps:

1. On the Client Devices page of the Tenovi dashboard, note down the Gateway ID of the device you want to disconnect (see image below).

2. Use the [disconnectDevice](/devices-api/api-reference/user/disconnect-device) or [revokeProviderAccess](/devices-api/api-reference/user/revoke-provider-access) endpoint to disconnect the currently-connected user from the device. This step also deactivates the device, preventing it from sending any further webhooks.

3. On the same page from step #1, click the Patient ID you would like to remove. Verify you clicked the ID of the patient that will **no longer** use this device. Press "Remove Patient" and confirm the action by clicking "OK".

4. Press the resulting "N/A" field under the Patient ID, and fill out the information for the new patient.

5. Re-activate the device by entering the Gateway ID from step #1.

6. Connect a new user by following the steps outlined in the [Setup](#setup) section using the Patient ID you entered in step #4.

<Callout intent="success">
  If you forgot to note down the Gateway ID for your device from step #1, you can find it on the
  sticker on the back of your Gateway device.
