## Coming Soon

<Callout intent="info">
  [Let us know](mailto:contact@metriport.com) if you need an integration we currently don't support.
  We also happily accept community contributions in [our GitHub
  repo](https://github.com/metriport/metriport)!
</Callout>

## Notes

### Garmin

Garmin is only supported through [webhooks](/home/api-info/webhooks).

As of now, our Garmin integration only supports new data - there's no option to
"backfill"/request a users' past data. [Let us know](mailto:contact@metriport.com) about
your use case if that's something you're looking for.

### Withings

For webhooks, Withings data will be returned as a summary for the entire day and willâ€‹ be updated as new data is added. We suggest taking this into account by potentially replacing the current data that you have with the new available summary.

### Connecting to Providers

<Callout intent="warn">
  Multiple connected users should not access the same provider account - even across enviroments.
  There are known issues where if you connect one user to an account and then later connect another
  user to that same provider account, the previous user's tokens will be revoked.
