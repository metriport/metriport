## Devices API messages

When using the Devices API, Metriport will send Webhook messages containing [new provider connections](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/more-info/webhooks#provider-connected-message) for each user, as well as [user data](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/more-info/webhooks#user-health-data-message) to your app from [our supported Providers](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/more-info/our-integrations), as soon as the data becomes available.

You can see Webhook details specific to the Devices API on [this page](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/more-info/webhooks).
​
## Medical API messages

When using the Medical API, Metriport will send Webhook messages containing status updates to your app, as soon as the data becomes available.

You can see Webhook details specific to the Medical API, including which operations trigger Webhook messages, on [this page](https://docs.metriport.com/medical-api/more-info/webhooks)
​
## Retries

Sometimes, due to temporary network disruption (or whatever other reason), a Webhook payload may fail to be delivered to your app. In these cases, Metriport will store the failed requests, and you can then manually retry them - using either the dashboard, or the API.

<Callout intent="warn">
If you do not have the Webhook URL configured, the Metriport will not attempt to deliver Webhook messages for the Medical API - in which case retries are not applicable.
</Callout>

## Retry Using the Dashboard

On the [Developers page](https://dash.metriport.com/developers) in the dashboard, you’re able to see the count of Webhook requests currently processing, and a count of outstanding ones that failed:

To retry failed requests, simply click the `Retry` button, and those requests will be sent to your app again.
​
## Retry Using the API

  1. Using the [Get Webhook Status endpoint](https://docs.metriport.com/home/api-reference/settings/get-webhook), check to see if there are any failed requests;
  2. Then, use the [Retry Webhook requests endpoint](https://docs.metriport.com/home/api-reference/settings/retry-webhook), to kick off the retry.

<Callout intent="warn">
Currently, the Metriport API doesn’t implement automatic retries - let us know if this is something you need.
