Sometimes, due to temporary network disruption (or whatever other reason), a Webhook payload may fail to be delivered to your app. In these cases, Metriport will store the failed requests, and you can then manually retry them - using either the dashboard, or the API.

<Callout intent="warn">
If you do not have the Webhook URL configured, the Metriport will not attempt to deliver Webhook messages for the Medical API - in which case retries are not applicable.
</Callout>

## Retry Using the Dashboard

On the [Developers page](https://dash.metriport.com/developers) in the dashboard, you’re able to see the count of Webhook requests currently processing, and a count of outstanding ones that failed:

To retry failed requests, simply click the `Retry` button, and those requests will be sent to your app again.
​
## Retry Using the API

  1. Using the [Get Webhook Status endpoint](https://docs.metriport.com/home/api-reference/settings/get-webhook), check to see if there are any failed requests;
  2. Then, use the [Retry Webhook requests endpoint](https://docs.metriport.com/home/api-reference/settings/retry-webhook), to kick off the retry.

<Callout intent="warn">
Currently, the Metriport API doesn’t implement automatic retries - let us know if this is something you need.
