How to access the Medical API using our SDK

We've developed an SDK to help you get access to our API without the HTTP plumbing. It's currently only available for
Node-based applications ([let us know](https://www.metriport.com/contact-us) what other languages you'd like to see it available on).

The SDK is available as an NPM package and you can access it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metriport/api-sdk).

To install:
<CodeBlock title = "Shell">
  ```shell
  npm install --save @metriport/api-sdk
  ```
</CodeBlock>

Initialize it like so:

<CodeBlock title = "Nodejs">
  ```typescript
  import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";

  const metriportClient = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");
  ```
</CodeBlock>

Some examples of usage, once the API client is initialized:

<CodeBlock title = "Nodejs">
  ```typescript
  // Create a Facility
  const patient = await metriportClient.createFacility({
    // facility data
  });

// Get a Patient
const patient = await metriportClient.getPatient(patientId);

// List the given Patient's available documents/records
const documents = await metriportClient.listDocuments(patientId, facilityId);
```
</CodeBlock>

The operations available follow the [API specification](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization), 
with this pattern:
- `GET /` endpoints are exposed as `list<EntityNameInPlural>()`
- `GET /:id` endpoints are exposed as `get<EntityName>()`
- `POST /` endpoints are exposed as `create<EntityName>()`
- `PUT /:id` endpoints are exposed as `update<EntityName>()`
- `DELETE /:id` endpoints are exposed as `remove<EntityName>()`

The client source code contain only the exposed operations and is available
[here](https://github.com/metriport/metriport/blob/develop/packages/api-sdk/src/medical/client/metriport.ts).
