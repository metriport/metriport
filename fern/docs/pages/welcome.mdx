Metriport helps you access and manage your users' and patients' health and medical data, through an open-source universal API.

The Metriport API, split between the [Medical API](/medical-api) and [Device API](/devices-api), adheres to REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs. It supports form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and utilizes standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
