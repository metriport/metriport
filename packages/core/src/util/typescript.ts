/**
 * VSCode doesn't expand complex types on the inspector properly,
 * when those types are more complex.
 *
 * This is just a hack, work around to display complex types
 * on VSCode's inspector (hovering the mouse over a type).
 *
 * This is the issue to fix this:
 * https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/94679
 *
 * These are marked as @deprecated so we don't keep them around,
 * they are just for local environemnts and shouldn't be used
 * to update actual domain types sent to remote branches.
