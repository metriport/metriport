# Terminology Server

## Overview

This project provides a term server for lookups in SNOMED, ICD, LOINC, and RXNORM, CPT, and CVX and crosswalks between SNOMED and ICD.
Currently, this is mostly intended for internal use.

## Getting Started

### First Time Setup

You'll need the UMLS Metathesaurus to run the terminology server. There are two ways to get it:

**For Metriport devs:**

1. Set up the `.env` with:

```
AWS_REGION=<staging-region>
TERMINOLOGY_BUCKET=<umls-bucket>
```

2. Run `npm run start` - this will automatically download the Metathesaurus from S3 if it's not already in your local directory

**For external users:**

1. Sign up for the UMLS Licence (typically takes a few business days) by following [this link](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/signup-login).
1. Download the Metathesaurus from [UMLS Knowledge Sources](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html)  
   **Note:** The file is large - 4 GB compressed and 28 GB uncompressed. Releases occur twice a year.
1. Put the downloaded zip in the root of the terminology directory.

### Seeding the Database

If you're setting up from the raw Metathesaurus file, you'll need to seed the database. We currently support crosswalks for ICD-10 to SNOMED and SNOMED to ICD-10.

Run these commands:

```bash
npm run seed-lookup <path-to-metathesauruszip>
npm run seed-crosswalk <path-to-metathesauruszip>
```

### Running the Server

Once you have the database file (either uploaded on S3 or seeded locally):

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will look for `terminology.db` in the local directory. If you're a Metriport dev and the file isn't found locally, it will automatically download from S3.

## Testing with Docker

To test the server locally using Docker, run:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## Supported Systems

Currently, the Term Server supports the following systems:

| System     | URL                                         |

## APIs

### POST /code-system/lookup

Send a `POST` request to this route to look up a single code from one of the supported systems, and receive a result containing the description for that code.

#### Body

A JSON payload, containing a single FHIR Parameters object with required `parameter` fields.

```
  {
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [
