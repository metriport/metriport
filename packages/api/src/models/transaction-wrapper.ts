/**
 * Function to execute a callback on a DB transaction.
 * Generally used along 'lock' on the model to avoid deadlocks.
 * This means that particular DB record is literally locked for the duration of the transaction
 * and no other connections/transactions can access it (depends on the lock type). So the
 * operations on the callback should be short lived and return as soon as possible.
 * Also, make sure to use the provided 'transaction' parameter provided in the callback
 * in all DB operations, otherwise Sequelize will use a diff connection/transaction
 * to issue those - THIS CAN CAUSE A DEADLOCK.
